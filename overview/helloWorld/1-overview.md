## 👨‍💻 Why build Privacy-preserving dApps with iExec

<p>Imagine you're building a decentralized application (dApp) that needs to <strong> handle sensitive user data</strong>, for example:</p>
<div class="use-case-card">
  <div class="examples-list">
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🤖</span>
      <span>An AI model training on sensitive data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">💰</span>
      <span>A financial app handling financial data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🔬</span>
      <span>A research platform working with private datasets</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🏥</span>
      <span>A healthcare app processing confidential patient records</span>
    </div>

<div class="solution-note purple">
  <p>This is where <span class="highlight">iExec</span> comes in! We provide tools to easily add <span class="highlight">privacy</span> and <span class="highlight">monetization</span> features into your dApp.</p>
</div>

## 👷 How do we solve it?

Unlike traditional security solutions, iExec protects your data throughout its
entire lifecycle, during storage, transfer, and even while **being processed by
applications.**

This is made possible thanks to
<span class="highlight"><a target="_blank" href="https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/for-developers/confidential-computing/intel-sgx-technology">Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE)</a></span> and
<span class="highlight"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.iex.ec/academy/iexec-decentralized-confidential-computing">Confidential
Computing</a></span> technologies.

<div class="solution-note purple">
  <p>Our technology allows users to control the <span class="highlight">ownership</span>,
  <span class="highlight">confidentiality</span>, and <span class="highlight">monetization</span> of their data and digital assets within the <span class="highlight">Web3</span> ecosystem.</p>
</div>

## 🔒 What are the three key elements?

iExec combines three fundamental elements that work together seamlessly:

#### 1. Protect data with our devtool [DataProtector](../../tools/dataProtector/getting-started)

- Encrypt your sensitive data and store it securely on IPFS
- Only you control who can access it and when
- Perfect for private information like research data, business analytics, or
  personal records

#### 2. Compute data with iExec apps (iApps) running in secure environment

- Special applications that can work with protected data
- Run in secure environments (called TEEs) that keep your data private
- Process data without exposing sensitive information

#### 3. Set the rules with the blockchain layer

- Enables tokenization of data
- Regain ownership of your data
- Provides transparent governance rules for data access

<div class="solution-note purple">
  <p>By merging <span class="highlight">blockchain technology</span> with <span class="highlight">confidential computing</span>, we've pioneered <span class="highlight"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.iex.ec/academy/iexec-decentralized-confidential-computing">DeCC</a></span> (Decentralized Confidential Computing) to take <span class="highlight">privacy</span> and <span class="highlight">security</span> to the next level in <span class="highlight">Web3</span> ecosystems.</p>
</div>

### 🧸 DeCC explained like you're 5

Imagine a **secure room**, like a private bank vault for data, where everything
inside stays **safe** and **private**.

With a tool called **DataProtector**, your data becomes **protected** and can
only be read and processed inside this secure room.

Special applications called **iApps** (applications built to run in secure
environments) can enter the room to work with your data. You stay in **control**
by setting **access rules** that only you can modify about who can access it and
when.

## 🔍 Building your first Privacy-preserving dApp

Let's meet Bob and Alice to understand how iExec enables Privacy-preserving
applications:

### 1. Meet Bob: the dApp developer 👨‍💻

Bob is building a decentralized application that leverages iExec's technology.
His platform consists of:

- A user-friendly interface for users.
- A DataProtector SDK that's easy to integrate into any application.
- Thanks to DataProtector, end users can protect their data, manage access, and
  process it seamlessly.

### 2. Meet Alice: the dApp user 👩‍💼

When using Bob's platform, Alice can:

- Protect her data using the Bob's platform's DataProtector feature
- Maintain full control over who can access her protected data
- Authorize specific iExec Apps and persons like Bob to use her data in a secure
  environment

Depending on the dApp's use case, Alice could:

- Apply algorithms to her data and get results confidentially
- Share her data with other users privately (and get paid for it)
- Ask questions to AI models about her data and get answers confidentially

And many other use cases...
