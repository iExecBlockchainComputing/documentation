# Pay per task model

We are introducing a new method for pricing and we have defined several task categories that describe the execution boundaries. We'll setup a test infrastructure so that application developers can evaluate the category of their submissions. Conversely, worker pools will be able to benchmark their infrastructures against the reference machine.

In the future, we'll redefine the categories, and provide more advanced tools for helping developers to maximize the usage of the infrastructure

**Categories Description:**

| **Category** | **Computing Time (C)** | **Deal Time (D)** |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0 – XS       | 5 min                  | 50 min            |
| 1 – S        | 20 min                 | 200 min (3h20m)   |
| 2 – M        | 1 hour                 | 10h               |
| 3 – L        | 3 hour                 | 30h (1d6h)        |
| 4 – XL       | 10 hour                | 100h (4d4h)       |

- Each worker will allocate **C** minutes to compute the application. If the computation is not completed within this **Computing Time**, the running application will be stopped.
- From a buyer perspective, a requester will be able to claim a task of a deal after **D** minutes if the task is not completed within the **Deal Time**.
