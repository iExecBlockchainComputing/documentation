# ⚙️ Advanced iApp Building

::: warning Important

This section contains legacy, low-level material. Please note:

- Terminology and some concepts may have changed in the current documentation.
- These topics are intentionally advanced and can be complex to understand.
- In most cases, you should not need to dive into this section — we’ve
  simplified and streamlined recommended paths elsewhere in the docs.

If you believe you truly need these advanced flows or you’re unsure which path
to take, please contact our support so we can understand your use case and help
you efficiently: [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/9h25DQFSCU).
