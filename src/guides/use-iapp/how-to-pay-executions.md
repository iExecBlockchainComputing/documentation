# ðŸ’° How to Pay for iApp Executions

Understanding how to pay for iApp executions is crucial for using the iExec
network effectively. This guide covers all payment methods, pricing structures,
and cost management strategies.

## Payment Methods Overview

iExec supports multiple payment methods for executing iApp:

1. **RLC Tokens**: Direct payment using RLC tokens
2. **Vouchers**: Pre-funded vouchers for simplified payment
3. **Mixed Payment**: Combination of RLC and vouchers

## Paying with RLC Tokens

RLC tokens are the native currency of the iExec network. You need to have RLC in
your wallet to pay for executions.

### Step 1: Get RLC Tokens

For detailed information on how to obtain RLC tokens, see our
[RLC guide](/get-started/overview/rlc.md).

### Step 2: Stake RLC to Power Your iExec Tasks

RLC tokens need to be staked on the iExec protocol to allow task payment. To do
this, you should use the [iExec SDK](/references/sdk.md).

```ts twoslash
import { IExec, utils } from 'iexec';

const ethProvider = utils.getSignerFromPrivateKey(
  'chain', // blockchain node URL
  'PRIVATE_KEY'
);
const iexec = new IExec({
  ethProvider,
});
// ---cut---
// Check your balance
const balance = await iexec.account.checkBalance('0xa0c15e...');
console.log('Nano RLC staked:', balance.stake.toString());
console.log('Nano RLC locked:', balance.locked.toString());

// Lock RLC in your account in the iExec protocol
await iexec.account.deposit(1_000_000_000); // Deposit 1 RLC
```

Now you are ready to run a task on the iExec Protocol and pay for it. See our
guide on
[running iApps with ProtectedData](/guides/use-iapp/run-iapp-with-ProtectedData.md)
for detailed execution steps.

## Paying with Vouchers <ChainNotSupportedBadge />

Vouchers are pre-funded payment instruments that simplify the payment process
and can be shared with others. They are ERC-20 tokens that represent pre-funded
computation credits on the iExec network and offer several advantages:
simplified payment (no need to manage RLC transfers), sharing capabilities (can
be shared with team members or users), budget control (set spending limits), and
automated top-up (can be configured to automatically refill).

### Step 1: Obtain a Voucher

- **Acquire Vouchers**: Obtain vouchers through the
  [iExec Builder Dashboard](https://builder.iex.ec/). Note that the number of
  Web3Mail executions and the expiration time of each voucher is restricted
  based on its validity period. Refer to
  [pricing documentation](https://www.iex.ec/voucher) for more information.
- **Support**: For specific limitations related to your voucher, please contact
  iExec Support.

### Step 2: Use the Builder Dashboard

The iExec Builder Dashboard manages vouchers and resources with an intuitive
interface for:

- **Claiming Vouchers**: Builders can claim vouchers during the BUILD and EARN
  stages.
- **Top-Up Vouchers**: Future updates will allow direct top-ups via the
  dashboard. Currently, builders are redirected to Discord.
- **Checking Voucher Balance**: Track your voucher balance and usage history.

### Step 3: Grant Allowance (If Necessary)

Use [iExec SDK](/references/sdk.md) with `iexec.account.approve(voucherAddress)`
to authorize the voucher smart contract to debit your account if the voucher
balance is insufficient. This ensures that if the voucher alone doesn't cover
the execution cost, the remaining balance is automatically deducted from your
account.

For additional information on using RLC for fallback payment in Web3Mail, refer
to the **Using RLC with Web3Mail** section.

### Step 4: Use Voucher

::: code-group

```ts twoslash [Web3Mail]
import { IExecWeb3mail, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/web3mail';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const web3mail = new IExecWeb3mail(web3Provider);
// ---cut---
const sendEmail = await web3mail.sendEmail({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...',
  emailSubject: 'My email subject',
  emailContent: 'My email content',
  useVoucher: true, // [!code focus]
});
```

```ts twoslash [Web3Telegram]
import { IExecWeb3telegram, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/web3telegram';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const web3telegram = new IExecWeb3telegram(web3Provider);
// ---cut---

const sendTelegram = await web3telegram.sendTelegram({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...',
  telegramContent: 'My telegram message content',
  senderName: 'Awesome project team',
  label: 'some-custom-id',
  dataMaxPrice: 42,
  appMaxPrice: 42,
  workerpoolMaxPrice: 42,
  useVoucher: true, // [!code focus]
});
```

```ts twoslash [Any iApp]
import { IExecDataProtectorCore, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/dataprotector';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const dataProtectorCore = new IExecDataProtectorCore(web3Provider);
// ---cut---
const result = await dataProtectorCore.processProtectedData({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...',
  app: '0x456def...',
  useVoucher: true, // [!code focus]
});
```

:::

::: tip

If your voucher doesn't have enough RLC to cover the deal, the SDK will
automatically get the required amount to your iExec account. Ensure that your
voucher is authorized to access your iExec account and that your account has
sufficient funds for this transfer to proceed.

:::

### Step 4: Use Someone Else Voucher

```ts twoslash [Any iApp]
import { IExecDataProtectorCore, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/dataprotector';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const dataProtectorCore = new IExecDataProtectorCore(web3Provider);
// ---cut---
const result = await dataProtectorCore.processProtectedData({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...',
  app: '0x456def...',
  useVoucher: true, // [!code focus]
  voucherOwner: '0x5714eB...', // [!code focus]
});
```

::: warning

Make sure the voucher's owner has authorized you to use it. This parameter must
be used in combination with `useVoucher: true`.

## Understanding Pricing

### Cost components

iApp execution costs consist of several components:

1. **Application Fee**: Paid to the app developer
2. **Data Fee**: Paid to the data owner (if using protected data)
3. **Workerpool Fee**: Paid to the computation provider
4. **Gas Fees**: Blockchain transaction costs

### Setting maximum prices

You can control costs by setting maximum prices for each component:

```ts twoslash
import { IExecDataProtectorCore, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/dataprotector';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const dataProtectorCore = new IExecDataProtectorCore(web3Provider);
// ---cut---
const result = await dataProtectorCore.processProtectedData({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...',
  app: '0x456def...',
  dataMaxPrice: 5, // Maximum amount (in nRLC) to pay the protected data owner
  appMaxPrice: 3, // Maximum amount (in nRLC) to pay the iApp provider
  workerpoolMaxPrice: 2, // Maximum amount (in nRLC) to pay the workerpool provider
});
```

::: info

All price parameters are in nRLC (nano RLC). The default value for all price
parameters is 0, which means only free resources are accepted.
