# ðŸš€ Getting Started with iApp

Welcome to secure, privacy-preserving computation! This guide shows you how to
use iApp on the iExec confidential computing network.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Some RLC tokens for paying computation fees (or access to free vouchers
  through learning programs) -
  [Learn about RLC tokens](/get-started/overview/rlc) and
  [how to bridge them](/get-started/tooling-and-explorers/bridge)
- Basic understanding of blockchain transactions
- iExec SDK installed

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install -g iexec
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn global add iexec
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -g iexec
```

```sh [bun]
bun add -g iexec
```

## Overview: How to Use iApp

Using iApp involves these main steps:

1. **Find iApp** - Browse available applications in the
   [iExec Explorer](/get-started/tooling-and-explorers/iexec-explorer)
2. **Prepare Data** - Set up any required protected data or inputs
3. **Execute** - Run the iApp
4. **Get Results** - Retrieve your computation results

### Understanding Orders

iApp are executed through a marketplace system where different actors publish
orders:

- **App orders** - Published by developers with pricing and availability
- **Workerpool orders** - Published by computation providers with capacity and
  pricing
- **Dataset orders** - Published by data owners with access conditions and
  pricing

When you execute an iApp, the system matches your request with available orders
from all three categories. For a deeper understanding of how orders work and how
to manage them, see the
[Build & Deploy guide](/guides/build-iapp/build-&-deploy) in the Build iApp
section.
