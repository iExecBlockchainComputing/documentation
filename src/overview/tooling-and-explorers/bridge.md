# RLC Bridge

**RLC** (RLC Token) is the essential cryptocurrency for interacting with the
iExec protocol. Whether you are executing tasks, accessing protected data, or
participating in the iExec decentralized confidential computing network, you
will need RLC tokens on the appropriate network.

This guide helps you bridge RLC tokens to **Bellecour** (becoming xRLC) and
**Arbitrum** networks using dedicated bridge solutions.

## üéØ Why Bridge RLC?

RLC tokens are required for various iExec protocol interactions:

- **Task Execution**: Pay for confidential computing tasks
- **Data Access**: Purchase access to protected datasets
- **Application Usage**: Pay for iApp executions

## üóÇÔ∏è Available Bridges

iExec provides dedicated bridge solutions for seamless token transfers across
networks:

Ethereum mainnet and the Bellecour sidechain in both directions.

### From Ethereum to Bellecour (RLC ‚Üí xRLC)

1. **Connect Wallet**: Visit
   [Bellecour Bridge](https://bridge-bellecour.iex.ec/) and connect your wallet
2. **Switch to Ethereum**: Ensure your wallet is connected to Ethereum mainnet
3. **Select Amount**: Choose the amount of RLC you want to bridge

  <h4 class="!mt-0 !mb-2">üîÑ Bidirectional Bridge</h4>
  <p class="!mb-0">The bridge interface automatically detects your wallet's network and available tokens. The process is similar in both directions - simply switch to the appropriate network (source chain) in your wallet and refresh the page to update the bridge direction, then the bridge will handle the conversion between RLC and xRLC seamlessly.</p>
