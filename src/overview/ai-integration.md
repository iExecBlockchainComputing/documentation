# ü§ñ AI-Powered Development with iExec

Building privacy-first applications with iExec can be accelerated using
AI-powered development tools. This guide covers how to effectively use AI
assistants while maintaining security best practices.

## üé® Vibe Coding Integration

Vibe coding is a modern way to build applications by describing what you want in
plain language. An AI assistant (like Cursor or ChatGPT) then generates code
based on your description.

It's fast, creative, and helps you prototype ideas quickly, even if you're not a
technical expert.

### üéØ Using vibe coding with iExec:

- Write a prompt like: "I want to create a form able to protect my data with
  DataProtector"

- The AI suggests code using iExec tools like DataProtector or iApp Generator

- You review and adjust until it works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

While vibe coding is powerful, it's important to keep privacy and security in
mind:

- **Review the code**: Always check AI-generated code for bugs or
  vulnerabilities

- **Don't share secrets**: Never paste API keys, private keys, or sensitive
  logic into the AI

- **Validate privacy logic**: Make sure your confidential computing flow is
  correctly implemented

- **Test thoroughly**: Especially when handling protected data or smart contract
  logic

## ü§ñ Documentation for LLMs and AI code editors

You can use some MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers like
[Context7](https://context7.com/iexecblockchaincomputing/documentation-tools) to
provide:

- Code completion with iExec-specific knowledge
- Architecture suggestions for privacy-first apps
- Code explanation and best practices
