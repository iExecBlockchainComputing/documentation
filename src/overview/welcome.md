## Why We Exist

In a world where data privacy is increasingly critical, developers need better

  complex infrastructure
- **Programmable Data Control**: Define who can access data, when, and how - all
  through simple tools
- **Native Interoperability**: Build once, deploy anywhere with EVM
  compatibility
- **Developer-First Experience**: Focus on building your application, not
  privacy plumbing
