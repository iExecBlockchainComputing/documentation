# ðŸ’¡ What We Do

iExec is a decentralized marketplace for computing resources. We enable
developers to build applications that combine **ownership**, **privacy**, and
**monetization**.

## Our Mission

We believe in a future where:

- Data owners maintain control over their information
- Developers can access powerful computing resources on-demand
- Privacy is preserved through trusted execution environments
- Anyone can monetize their data and computing power

## Key Technologies

### Protected Data

Secure your data while maintaining control over who can access and use it.

### iApps (iExec Applications)

Decentralized applications that run on the iExec network, ensuring privacy and
verifiability.

### Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)

Computing in secure enclaves that guarantee privacy and integrity.
