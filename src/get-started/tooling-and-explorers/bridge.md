# RLC Bridge

**RLC** (RLC Token) powers all iExec protocol interactions. You need RLC tokens
whether you're executing tasks, accessing protected data, or participating in
the iExec confidential computing network.

This guide helps you bridge RLC tokens to **Bellecour** (becoming xRLC) and
**Arbitrum** networks using the Bellecour Bridge and Stargate Bridge.

::: tip üß™ Testing on Arbitrum Sepolia

For development and testing purposes, you can get free RLC tokens on **Arbitrum
Sepolia testnet** using the
[iExec RLC Faucet](https://explorer.iex.ec/arbitrum-sepolia-testnet/faucet).
This allows you to test your iApps, pay for workerpool executions, and access
protected datasets without spending real tokens.

## ‚ö° Stargate Bridge

The **Stargate Bridge** powered by LayerZero enables cross-chain transfers of
RLC tokens between Ethereum and Arbitrum mainnet in both directions.

### Ethereum <> Arbitrum (RLC <> RLC)

1. **Visit Stargate**: Go to [Stargate UI](https://stargate.finance/bridge)
2. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your wallet to the Stargate interface
3. **Select Networks**: Choose your source network (Ethereum or Arbitrum) and
   destination network
4. **Select Token**: Choose RLC as the token to bridge
5. **Enter Amount**: Specify the amount of RLC to transfer
6. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve the bridge transaction and wait for
   confirmation

## üîÑ Bellecour Bridge

The **Bellecour Bridge** enables seamless transfer of RLC tokens between
Ethereum mainnet and the Bellecour sidechain in both directions. When bridged to
Bellecour, RLC becomes xRLC, the native asset of the Bellecour network.

### Ethereum <> Bellecour (RLC <> xRLC)

1. **Connect Wallet**: Visit
   [Bellecour Bridge UI](https://bridge-bellecour.iex.ec/) and connect your
   wallet
2. **Select Source Network**: The bridge automatically detects your current
   network and available tokens (RLC on Ethereum or xRLC on Bellecour)
3. **Choose Destination**: The bridge will show the opposite network as
   destination automatically
4. **Select Amount**: Choose the amount of tokens you want to bridge
5. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve the bridge transaction and wait for
   confirmation
6. **Receive Tokens**: Your tokens will be available on the destination network

::: tip üîÑ Bidirectional Bridge

The bridge interface automatically detects your wallet's network and available
tokens. The process is similar in both directions - simply switch to the
appropriate network (source chain) in your wallet and refresh the page to update
the bridge direction, then the bridge will handle the conversion between RLC and
xRLC seamlessly.

## üîí Security & Audits

The **Stargate Bridge** uses the **LayerZero protocol** under the hood, which
provides secure cross-chain communication infrastructure. LayerZero is a
decentralized protocol that enables trustless cross-chain messaging without
requiring intermediate chains or wrapped tokens.
