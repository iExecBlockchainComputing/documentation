# ðŸš° RLC Faucet

Get free RLC tokens on **Arbitrum Sepolia testnet** to test your iApps, pay for
workerpool executions, and access protected datasets without spending real
tokens.

## What are RLC Tokens Used For?

In the iExec ecosystem, RLC tokens are used to pay for various services:

- **Pay Workerpools** - Compensate computational resources for executing your
  iApps
- **Pay Protected Data Providers** - Access and use protected datasets in your
  applications
- **Pay iApp Providers** - Use decentralized applications deployed on the
  network

These testnet RLC tokens allow you to test all these payment flows without
spending real tokens.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for RLC claims, builders must meet these criteria:

- **GitHub login** required for verification
- **Maximum 1 RLC** in your wallet to claim (prevents abuse and ensures fair
  distribution)
- **One claim per 24 hours** per authenticated account
