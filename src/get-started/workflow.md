# Build with iExec - Complete Workflow

This guide walks you through building a complete application with iExec
technology using DataProtector & IApp generator, from initial setup to live
deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- Ethereum wallet
- Docker installed & Docker Hub account

## Step 1: Install iExec SDK and Tools

```bash
# Install iExec dependencies
npm install @iexec/dataprotector @iexec/iapp

```

## Step 2: Set a front end

You will need a front-end application to allow users to interact with your
platform and use DataProtector to protect their data.

To quickly bootstrap a Next.js project with DataProtector installed, use our
starter template:
[iExec Next.js Starter](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-nextjs-starter)

This template is composed with a simple Next.js project with a form enabling the
data protection through Dataprotector.

This starter is set up with iExec network by default, but you can change the
deployment chain.

## Step 3: Build Your iExec Application (iApp)

### 3.1 Check iApp Generator installation.

Open your terminal and check if the iApp generator package is well installed on
your environment by running the following command:

```bash
iapp --version
```

### 3.2 Init & Custom you iApp

In order to compute protected data generated by DataProtector in a private and
confidential TEE environment, you need to bootstrap and customize your
application with iApp generator before deploying it on the selected chain.
Please follow this guide:
[iApp Generator](/references/iapp-generator/getting-started)

### 3.3 Deploy your iApp

Once your iApp is ready, you can deploy it on the selected chain by running the
deploy command. Please follow this guide
[Deploy an iApp](/guides/build-iapp/deploy-&-run)

## Step 4: Manage access

Once your DataProtector workflow is installed on your frontend and your iExec
application is deployed, you can Manage Access. This means you need to authorize
both a user and the iExec application to process the data using the Grant Access
method. Please follow this guide
[Manage Access](/guides/build-iapp/manage-access)

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct network
  (iExec mainnet)
- **Gas Fees**: Make sure you have sufficient RLC for transactions
- **TEE Execution**: Verify your application is compatible with Trusted
  Execution Environments
- **Data Access**: Check that your application has proper access to protected
  datasets
