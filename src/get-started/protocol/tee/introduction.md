# üõ°Ô∏è Introduction to TEE Technologies

**Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** are the foundation of confidential
computing, providing hardware-level security for sensitive applications and data
processing. On the iExec platform, TEE technologies enable secure,
privacy-preserving computation in a decentralized environment.

## What is Confidential Computing?

**Confidential Computing** (or **Trusted Execution Environments - TEE**) ensures
computation confidentiality through mechanisms of memory encryption at the
hardware level. Applications being executed and data being processed are
safeguarded against even the most privileged access levels (OS, Hypervisor...).
Only authorized code can run inside this protected area and manipulate its data.

In some cases, ensuring that code runs correctly without any third party
altering the execution, is even more important than hiding the computation's
data. This concept is called **Trusted Computing.**

These guarantees are critical for a decentralized cloud where code is being
executed on a remote machine, that is not controlled by the requester. They are
also required to prevent leakage while monetizing data sets.

## Why TEE Matters for iExec

iExec is a decentralized cloud computing platform that enables secure,
privacy-preserving computation. TEE technologies are essential to iExec's
mission because:

### üîí **Decentralized Trust**

- **Problem**: In a decentralized network, you can't trust individual workers
- **Solution**: TEE provides hardware-level guarantees regardless of who owns
  the hardware
- **iExec Benefit**: Users can trust computation results even from unknown
  workers

### üí∞ **Data Monetization**

- **Problem**: Data owners can't safely share their data for computation
- **Solution**: TEE ensures data remains encrypted and private during processing
- **iExec Benefit**: Data providers can monetize their data without losing
  control

### üåê **Global Computation**

- **Problem**: Sensitive applications can't run on untrusted infrastructure
- **Solution**: TEE creates secure environments anywhere in the world
- **iExec Benefit**: Applications can run globally while maintaining security

## Understanding TEE: The Foundation

Before diving into specific technologies, let's understand what TEE is and why
it matters.

### What is TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)?

Think of a **TEE** as a **secure vault inside your computer** where sensitive
operations happen. It's like having a private room that only authorized code can
enter, and once inside, everything is protected from the outside world - even
from the operating system itself.

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine a bank vault inside a regular building. The
building (your computer) can be accessed by many people, but the vault (TEE) has
special security measures that keep its contents completely private and secure.

### Why TEE Matters

**Traditional Computing Problems**:

- üîç **Data Exposure**: Your data is visible to the operating system and other
  applications
- üõ°Ô∏è **No Trust**: You can't trust remote computers to keep your data private
- üîì **Vulnerable**: Malicious software or compromised systems can access your
  data

**TEE Solutions**:

- üîí **Data Privacy**: Your data is encrypted and protected during processing
- üõ°Ô∏è **Hardware Security**: Special CPU features ensure data stays private
- üåê **Trust Anywhere**: Run securely on computers you don't control

### TEE vs Regular Computing

| **Regular Computing**           | **TEE Computing**                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Code and data visible to OS     | Code and data encrypted and hidden     |
| Vulnerable to system attacks    | Protected even from privileged access  |
| No hardware security guarantees | Hardware-level security protection     |
| Like working in a public space  | Like working in a secure, private room |

```

## How TEE Works

### Core Principles

1. **Hardware Protection**: Special CPU features create isolated, secure areas
2. **Memory Encryption**: All data in the secure area is automatically encrypted
3. **Access Control**: Only authorized code can enter the secure area
4. **Integrity Verification**: The system can prove it's running the correct
   code

### iExec's TEE Infrastructure

iExec provides a complete TEE infrastructure that includes:

- **üîê Secret Management Service (SMS)**: Secure storage for encryption keys and
  secrets
