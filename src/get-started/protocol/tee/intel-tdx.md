# 🛡️ Intel TDX Technology

**Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions)** is Intel's next-generation confidential
computing technology, representing the evolution from application-level to
virtual machine-level protection. On the iExec platform, TDX is an
**experimental technology** that offers advanced capabilities for
memory-intensive workloads and legacy application migration.

## What is Intel TDX?

**TDX (Trust Domain Extensions)** is Intel's newer confidential computing
technology that provides VM-level protection, allowing entire virtual machines
to run in secure, isolated environments.

### Key TDX Benefits

1. **🔄 Lift-and-Shift Compatibility**: Run existing applications with minimal
   changes
2. **💾 Large Memory Support**: Handle memory-intensive workloads (AI,
   databases)
3. **🛡️ VM-Level Protection**: Protect entire virtual machines, not just
   applications
4. **⚡ Better Performance**: Optimized for complex workloads

## TDX: The "Virtual Machine-Level" Security

**Intel TDX** is like having an **entire secure building** where you can move
your existing operations without major renovations. It protects entire virtual
machines.

### Key Characteristics

- **Scope**: Protects entire virtual machines
- **Memory**: Large secure memory space (like a large vault)
- **Code Changes**: Minimal changes needed - "lift and shift" approach
- **Use Case**: Ideal for complex applications, legacy systems, and AI workloads

**Analogy**: TDX is like moving your entire office into a secure building where
everything is protected.

## TDX with iExec

iExec is actively exploring TDX technology to expand the platform's capabilities
and prepare for the future of confidential computing.

### iExec's TDX Infrastructure

iExec provides experimental TDX support through:

- **🔬 Experimental Worker Pools**: Limited TDX-enabled workers for testing
- **📦 TDX Technology Support**: Integration with Intel TDX technology
- **🔐 Secret Management Service**: SMS support for TDX applications
- **📋 Task Verification**: Proof of contribution for TDX executions
- **🔗 Blockchain Integration**: Decentralized coordination and payment
