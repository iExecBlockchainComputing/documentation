# Deserialize a ProtectedData

If you want to build your own iApp (iExec TEE Dapp), you may need to access
protected data that your wallet and iApp are authorized to use. To achieve this,
you must deserialize the content of the protected data with the expected data
schema.

To simplify this process, you can use our lightweight utility package,
`@iexec/dataprotector-deserializer`, in your iApp. This package streamlines the
deserialization of protected data, making it easy for you to access and utilize
the information securely.

## Overview

This deserializer is built on the
[Borsh technical specification](https://borsh.io/). We developed this JavaScript
library to simplify deserialization in your iApp built with JavaScript.

::: warning

If you want to build your iApp in another language, you need to know how to
deserialize a protected data.

Under the hood, protected data are **zip files** replicating the tree structure
of the original data object. Each value is stored in a dedicated file, binary
values are stored as is while boolean, numbers, and strings are serialized with
borsh.

To access a value from a protected data, your app will need to unzip the iExec
dataset file at `$IEXEC_IN/$IEXEC_DATASET_FILENAME`. Then for `'bool'`, `'f64'`,
`'i128'` or `'string'` types, use the Borsh deserialization specification to
recover the original value. Borsh has
[implementations in various languages](https://github.com/near/borsh#implementations),
check your favorite one.

### Installation

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install @iexec/dataprotector-deserializer
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add @iexec/dataprotector-deserializer
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @iexec/dataprotector-deserializer
```

```sh [bun]
bun add @iexec/dataprotector-deserializer
```

### Instantiate SDK

```ts twoslash [NodeJS]
import { IExecDataProtectorDeserializer } from '@iexec/dataprotector-deserializer';

const deserializer = new IExecDataProtectorDeserializer();
```
