# ü§ñ iApp Generator

**Build privacy-first applications that run in secure TEE environments.** iApp
Generator is your complete toolkit for creating, testing, and deploying
confidential iApps on the iExec network.

Transform your ideas into production-ready privacy-preserving applications in
minutes, not months.

## What is iApp Generator?

**iApp Generator** is a CLI tool that simplifies building **iExec Applications
(iApps)** - applications that run inside **Trusted Execution Environments
(TEE)** for maximum privacy and security.

### What you Can Build

- **AI models** that process sensitive data privately
- **Data analysis** tools that protect user information
- **Custom algorithms** with confidential inputs and outputs
- **Privacy-preserving services** for Web3 applications

### What iApp Generator Provides

- ‚úÖ **Project scaffolding** - Complete iApp structure ready to deploy
- ‚úÖ **Local testing** - Debug and iterate quickly in simulation mode
- ‚úÖ **One-click deployment** - Deploy to TEE workers with a single command
- ‚úÖ **Input/output handling** - Seamless integration with protected data

## Quick Start Path

### 1. **Learn the Concepts**

Start here to understand what iApps are and how they work:

- **[What Is an iApp?](/build_iapp/iapp-generator/what-is-iapp)** - Core
  concepts and TEE overview
- **[Getting Started](/build_iapp/iapp-generator/getting-started)** - Your first
  iApp in 15 minutes
- **[Building Your iApp](/build_iapp/iapp-generator/building-your-iexec-app)** -
  Complete development guide

### 2. **Master the Development Workflow**

Once you've built your first iApp, level up with these practical guides:

- **[Inputs and Outputs](/build_iapp/guides/inputs-and-outputs)** - Handle data
  flow in TEE environment
- **[Debugging Your iApp](/build_iapp/guides/debugging-your-iapp)** -
  Troubleshoot execution issues
- **[App Access Control and Pricing](/build_iapp/guides/orders)** - Control who
  can use your iApp
- **[How to Get and Decrypt Results](/build_iapp/guides/how-to-get-and-decrypt-results)** -
  Retrieve and use outputs

## Why Choose iApp Generator?

### üîí **Privacy by Design**

Your applications run in hardware-secured enclaves where even the infrastructure
provider can't access your data or code.

### ‚ö° **Developer-Friendly**

Focus on your application logic while iApp Generator handles the complex TEE
setup, deployment, and execution infrastructure.

### üåç **Decentralized Infrastructure**

Deploy on a global network of TEE-enabled workers without managing servers or
cloud infrastructure.

### üîß **Complete Toolkit**

From local development to production deployment, everything you need is included
in one CLI tool.
