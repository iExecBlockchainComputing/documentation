# üöÄ What Is an iApp?

An iExec Application (iApp) is your regular application code (Python script, AI
model, data processor) that can securely process protected data (created by
DataProtector) inside a privacy-safe environment called TEE (a Trusted Execution
Environment).

## Why iApps Matter?

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400/10 to-purple-400/5 rounded-[6px] p-6 border-l-4 border-fuchsia-700 mb-6">
  <p class="m-0!"><strong>iApps let you process sensitive data while keeping it private and secure.</strong></p>
</div>

Imagine you want to build:

<div class="bg-[var(--vp-c-bg-soft)] rounded-[6px] p-6 mb-6">
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-2.5">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-base">
      <span>ü§ñ</span>
      <span>An AI that analyzes personal health data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-base">
      <span>üìß</span>
      <span>An email tool that needs access to contact lists</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-base">
      <span>üí∞</span>
      <span>A financial advisor that processes bank statements</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-base">
      <span>üõ°Ô∏è</span>
      <span>A content filter that reads private messages</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Users have this data, but they won't give it to your regular app. **With iApps,
they will.**

## How It Works

Your code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) a secure area inside
specific processors (Intel SGX/TDX chipset). Everything that happens there stays
private and protected, even from the operating system.

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-fuchsia-400/10 to-fuchsia-400/5 rounded-[6px] p-6 border-l-4 border-fuchsia-700 mb-6">
  <p class="m-0!">An authorized user can trigger an iApp that processes someone's protected data inside this private environment. The data is used, but never exposed, not even to the person running the app.</p>
</div>

## iApp Generator: Your Development Tool

Bootstrap TEE-compatible applications in minutes without any hardcoding skills,
iApp Generator handles all the low-level complexity for you.

- **Access to TEEs easily** - No need to dive into low-level requirements, build
  iApps that connect to TEE in minutes
- **Check and deploy iApps quickly** - iApp Generator checks that your iApp
  complies with the iExec Framework and streamlines its deployment
- **Select your project mode & language** - Select between basic or advanced
  setup depending on your iExec level experience. You also have the choice
  between Python or JavaScript

```bash
# Create your iApp (Python or Node.js supported)
iapp init my-sentiment-analyzer
cd my-sentiment-analyzer

# Develop and test locally (simulates TEE environment)
iapp test
# Deploy to the network
iapp deploy
```

  <p class="m-0! text-sm"><strong>Note:</strong> iApp Generator currently supports Python and Node.js, but iApps can be built in any language that runs in Docker.</p>
</div>

## Real Examples

**Email Notification iApp**

```python
# User runs: "Send updates to my contacts about my project"
contacts = load_protecteddata()  # User's protected contact list
for contact in contacts:
    send_email(contact, project_update_message)
# ‚Üí Emails sent directly, you never see the addresses
```

**Oracle Update iApp**

```python
# User runs: "Update price oracle with my private trading data"
trading_data = load_protecteddata()  # User's protected trading history
average_price = calculate_weighted_average(trading_data)
update_oracle_contract(average_price)
# ‚Üí Oracle updated with real data, trading history stays private
```

**Automated Transactions iApp**

```python
# User runs: "Buy tokens when my portfolio meets certain conditions"
portfolio = load_protecteddata()  # User's protected portfolio data
if should_buy_tokens(portfolio):
    execute_trade(token_address, amount)
# ‚Üí Trade executed based on private data, portfolio details stay hidden
```

## The Trust Model

Here's why users will actually use your iApp with their private data:

### What Users See

- ‚úÖ "This code runs in a secure enclave, not on the developer's servers"
- ‚úÖ "My data gets used privately for actions I want"
- ‚úÖ "Even iExec workers can't see my data during execution"
- ‚úÖ "I can revoke access anytime"

### What You Get

- ‚úÖ Users willing to use your services with their sensitive data
- ‚úÖ New business models around privacy-preserving analytics
- ‚úÖ Competitive advantage through privacy guarantees

### The Workflow

<div class="bg-[var(--vp-c-bg-soft)] rounded-[6px] p-6 mb-6">
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-bold">1</span>
      <span>User provides personal data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-bold">2</span>
      <span>Data is protected with DataProtector</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-bold">3</span>

    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-bold">4</span>
      <span>Your iApp runs inside TEE and processes protected data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-bold">5</span>
      <span>Actions performed while maintaining privacy</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400/10 to-purple-400/5 rounded-[6px] p-6 border-l-4 border-fuchsia-700 mb-6">
  <p class="m-0!"><strong>Nobody sees the raw data except your code running inside the secure enclave.</strong></p>
</div>

Your iApp can send emails, update contracts, make transactions, trigger
notifications - anything your code needs to do with the protected data. This
isn't about trust - it's about **mathematical guarantees** that privacy is
preserved.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

::: details üì¶ What can I build with iApps?

Anything that runs in Docker! AI models, data processing scripts, web scrapers,
image processing, financial calculations, etc. If it runs in a container, it can
be an iApp.

:::

::: details ‚ö°How fast are iApps?

Initial task scheduling takes ~30 seconds (depending on the resources the worker
download, congestion etc), then your code runs at normal speed depending on
complexity.

:::

::: details üõ°Ô∏è Are iApps really secure?

Yes! Code runs in Intel SGX or TDX secure enclaves. Even the worker running your
iApp can't see what's happening inside the enclave.

:::

::: details üöÄ How do I deploy my first iApp?

Try our [Hello World](/overview/helloWorld) for a quick start, or check the
[iApp Generator](/build_iapp/iapp-generator) section for detailed instructions.

:::

::: details üîß What programming languages are supported?

iApps can be built in any language that runs in Docker (Python, JavaScript, R,
Java, Go, etc.). However, **iApp Generator** currently supports only Python and
Node.js for simplified development.
