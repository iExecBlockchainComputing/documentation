DataProtector **simplifies secure data management**, offering users essential
tools for protecting, managing, and sharing their data effectively.

## DataProtector Core

As the foundational component of DataProtector, DataProtector Core provides
essential functionalities for data protection. Users can **encrypt their data**
and **record ownership on a smart contract**, ensuring confidentiality and
traceability. Granting access to authorized applications is streamlined,
facilitating secure data management.

With `DataProtector Core`, you can **grant access** to your protected data **to
a specific user**.

- You define the number of times the user can access the data.
- You should choose an iApp (iExec TEE Dapp) that will be able to process your
  protected data.
- You'll have to sign a transaction at the moment you grant access to the user
  and the iApp (iExec TEE Dapp).
