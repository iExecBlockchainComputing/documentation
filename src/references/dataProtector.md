DataProtector **simplifies secure data management**, offering users essential
tools for protecting, managing, and sharing their data effectively.

## DataProtector Core

As the foundational component of DataProtector, DataProtector Core provides
essential functionalities for data protection. Users can **encrypt their data**
and **record ownership on a smart contract**, ensuring confidentiality and
traceability. Granting access to authorized applications is streamlined,
facilitating secure data management.

## DataProtector Sharing

Building upon DataProtector Core, DataProtector Sharing introduces **advanced
features for data sharing** and ownership transfer. Users can securely transfer
ownership of protected data, enabling collaboration and potential **monetization
opportunities**. This module empowers users to share and manage their data
securely, fostering innovation and collaboration in the digital realm.

## Which One to Use?

With `DataProtector Core`, you can **grant access** to your protected data **to
a specific user**.

- You define the number of times the user can access the data.
- You should choose an iApp (iExec TEE Dapp) that will be able to process your
  protected data.
- You'll have to sign a transaction at the moment you grant access to the user
  and the iApp (iExec TEE Dapp).

With `DataProtector Sharing`, you can **distribute** your protected data to **a
wider audience**.

- You don't need to know the user's Ethereum address.
- You define a period of time and a price for which the user can access the
  data.
- Any user can access your content as long as they comply with your distribution
  and monetization choices.
