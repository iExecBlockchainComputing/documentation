# ðŸ¤– iApp Generator

**Here's the tool, what it does, and how to use it.** iApp Generator is a CLI
that builds applications running inside TEEs. You write code, we handle the
confidential computing setup.

## What is iApp Generator?

**iApp Generator** builds confidential applications. Your code runs in Intel
SGX/TDX secure enclaves where data stays private during processing.

### What you get

- **Project scaffolding** - Complete setup, ready to deploy
- **Local testing** - Debug in simulation mode before going live
- **Simple deployment** - One command deploys to TEE workers
- **Data integration** - Works with encrypted datasets out of the box

### What iApp Generator Provides

- âœ… **Project scaffolding** - Complete iApp structure ready to deploy
- âœ… **Local testing** - Debug and iterate quickly in simulation mode
- âœ… **One-click deployment** - Deploy to TEE workers with a single command
- âœ… **Input/output handling** - Seamless integration with protected data

## Quick Start Path

### 1. **Learn the Concepts**

Start here to understand what iApps are and how they work:

- **[What Is an iApp?](/get-started/overview/what-is-iapp)** - Core concepts and
  TEE overview
- **[Getting Started](/references/iapp-generator/getting-started)** - Your first
  iApp in 15 minutes
- **[Building Your iApp](/references/iapp-generator/building-your-iexec-app)** -
  Complete development guide

### 2. **Master the Development Workflow**

Once you've built your first iApp, level up with these practical guides:

- **[Inputs and Outputs](/guides/build-iapp/inputs-and-outputs)** - Handle data
  flow in TEE environment
- **[Debugging Your iApp](/guides/build-iapp/debugging)** - Troubleshoot
  execution issues
- **[App Access Control and Pricing](/guides/build-iapp/manage-access)** -
  Control who can use your iApp
- **[How to Get and Decrypt Results](/guides/build-iapp/how-to-get-and-decrypt-results)** -
  Retrieve and use outputs

### 3. **Explore Advanced Features**

  technology
- **[Complete Guides Overview](/guides/build-iapp/build-&-deploy)** - All
  development guides in one place

## Why Choose iApp Generator?

### Privacy without infrastructure overhead

Your code runs in Intel SGX/TDX enclaves. Even the worker running your app can't
see what's happening inside.

### You build, we handle the TEE complexity

Write normal application code. iApp Generator handles secure deployment, worker
coordination, and result encryption.

### Runs everywhere TEEs exist

Deploy across Intel-enabled workers globally. No server management, no cloud
provider lock-in.

### Complete toolkit

Development, testing, deployment, and execution - everything included in one
CLI.
