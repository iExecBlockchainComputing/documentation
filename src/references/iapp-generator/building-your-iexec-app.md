# üßë‚Äçüè≠ Build your iApp

## üß∞ Initialize your iApp

The iApp (iExec Application) Generator CLI simplifies the setup of your iApp by
guiding you through a step-by-step initialization process. This ensures your
iApp is correctly configured and compatible with iExec's confidential computing
environment.

### üèó Define your Project

<CLIDemo
  initialCommand="iapp init"
  asciiText="iApp"
  :steps="[
    {
      showAt: 2,
      completeAt: 4,
      question: 'What is your project name? (A folder with this name will be created)',
      answer: 'hello-world',
      showTyping: true,
      isComplete: false
    },
    {
      showAt: 4,
      completeAt: 6,
      question: 'Which language do you want to use?',
      answer: 'JavaScript',
      options: [
        { label: 'JavaScript', selected: true },
        { label: 'Python', selected: false }
      ],
      highlighted: false,
      isComplete: false
    },
    {
      showAt: 6,
      completeAt: 8,
      question: 'What kind of project do you want to init?',
      answer: 'Hello World',
      options: [
        { label: 'Hello World - iapp quick start', selected: true },
        { label: 'advanced', selected: false }
      ],
      highlighted: false,
      isComplete: false
    }
  ]"
  :completionStep="8"
  :completionMessage="'Generating your iApp...'"
  :completionItems="[
    'üìÅ Created hello-world/',
    'üìÑ Added package.json',
    'üê≥ Added Dockerfile',
    '‚öôÔ∏è Added iExec configuration'
  ]"
  :successMessage="'Your iApp is ready!'"
/>

Follow the prompts to specify:

- **Project name** ‚Äì Creates a folder for your project files.
- **Language** ‚Äì Choose between JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Project mode** ‚Äì Choose Basic (Hello-World setup) or Advanced mode.

### ‚öô Configure

You'll set up:

- **Arguments (Args)** ‚Äì Public parameters for your iApp.
- **Input Files** ‚Äì Files dynamically downloaded during execution. These can
  come from **a specific URL**.
- **Requester Secrets** ‚Äì Confidential authentication strings.
- **Protected Data** ‚Äì Encrypted data accessible only inside the TEE.
- **App Secret** ‚Äì Immutable secret provisioned by the iApp owner.

::: warning üí°

The Secret Management Service (SMS) securely stores application developer
secrets. Once set, the App Secret is immutable and cannot be updated. Use with
caution.

For more information on **App Secrets**, refer to
[Access confidential assets from your app](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/for-developers/confidential-computing/access-confidential-assets)

:::

For more details and to learn how to use them in your application, refer here
[Application I/O](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/for-developers/application-io)

## üöÄ Launch your iApp

After initialization, the following essential files and directories are
generated:

- `iapp.config.json`
- `src/app.js` _(JavaScript)_ or `src/app.py` _(Python)_
- `Dockerfile`
- Directories:
  - `input/`
  - `output/`
  - `cache/`

### üìù Update your iApp

To modify your main application logic open:

```sh
src/app.js  # For JavaScript
src/app.py  # For Python
```

::: info

üí° The `src/` directory contains the core logic of your iApp. Implement your
algorithms and data processing here.

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Commands Reference

### Core Commands

#### `iapp init`

**Purpose**: Initialize a new iApp project  
**Usage**: `iapp init`  
**Options**: Interactive prompts for project configuration  
**What it does**: Creates project structure, configuration files, and basic
templates

#### `iapp test`

**Purpose**: Test your iApp locally before deployment  
**Usage**: `iapp test`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Runs a basic test locally to validate your application logic

#### `iapp deploy`

**Purpose**: Deploy your iApp to the iExec network  
**Usage**: `iapp deploy`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Turns your code into a TEE app and registers the iApp on iExec

#### `iapp run <iAppAddress>`

**Purpose**: Execute your deployed iApp on a worker node  
**Usage**: `iapp run <iAppAddress>`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Sends your iApp for execution on the iExec network

#### `iapp debug <taskId>`

**Purpose**: Retrieve detailed execution logs from worker nodes  
**Usage**: `iapp debug <taskId>`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Provides detailed logs for debugging failed or slow executions

#### `iapp mock <inputType>`

**Purpose**: Create mocked input for testing purposes  
**Usage**: `iapp mock <inputType>`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Generates sample input data to test your iApp locally

#### `iapp --help`

**Purpose**: Display all available commands and options  
**Usage**: `iapp --help`  
**Options**: None  
**What it does**: Shows comprehensive help information for all CLI commands

### Advanced Options

#### Environment Variables

##### `EXPERIMENTAL_TDX_APP=true`

**Purpose**: Enable experimental Intel TDX support  
**Usage**: Set as environment variable before running commands  
**Example**: `EXPERIMENTAL_TDX_APP=true iapp test`  
**What it does**: Enables TDX mode for testing, deployment, and execution

**Available with**:

- `iapp test`
- `iapp deploy`
- `iapp run <app-address>`

::: info TDX <ChainNotSupportedBadge />

üß™ While **TEE** iApp are based on **intel SGX** technology by default, iApp has
an experimental support for **intel TDX** applications.

TDX mode is enabled by setting the environment variable
`EXPERIMENTAL_TDX_APP=true`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind: TDX mode is experimental and can be subject to instabilities or
discontinuity.
