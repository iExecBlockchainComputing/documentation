# iApp

Building your own iApp is essential if you want to utilize our development tools
to their full potential.

### What is an iApp?

An iApp is an iExec TEE decentralized application that operates within a
decentralized infrastructure based on the SCONE TEE framework. This framework
ensures full privacy during the execution of the Dapp.

### In which languages can I build my iApp?

It depends on the SCONE TEE framework. Currently, you can use Go, Rust, Python,
and JavaScript.

### How to build my iApp?

To build your iApp, you can follow the
[protocol documentation](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/for-developers/your-first-app).
We are continuously working on aspects to streamline and simplify your iApp
development experience.
