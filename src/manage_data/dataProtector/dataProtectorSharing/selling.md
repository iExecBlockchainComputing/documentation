# Data sharing - Selling

The owner of protected data may list the data for sale. Upon completion of a
sale, ownership of the protected data transfers to the buyer. This is a
permanent operation enforced by the blockchain and executed by the Data Sharing
smart contract. The data owner may de-list the protected data at any point until
a sale is completed. The new owner of the protected data has full rights to
distribute the protected data through any channels they desire.
