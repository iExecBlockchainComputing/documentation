# ðŸ§™ Oracle Factory

Oracle Factory introduces a streamlined and efficient way for developers to
integrate real-world data into blockchain applications. Leveraging the power of
the iExec decentralized cloud infrastructure, Oracle Factory ensures the
creation of reliable and trustworthy oracles.

Key features of Oracle Factory include:

- **createOracle** â€” This method allows for the creation of custom oracles from
  any API, with a limitation of one data return per oracle. This feature is
  pivotal in fetching specific, relevant data for decentralized applications,
  Oracles can be created solely from APIs to return data types such as 'number',
  'string', and 'boolean', ensuring flexibility and compatibility with various
  data sources.
- **readOracle** â€” This method allows users to retrieve the value from the
  oracle.
- **updateOracle** â€” This method ensures that the oracle stays current by
  fetching the latest data from its linked API. It maintains the oracle's
  relevance and accuracy, crucial for real-time data-dependent applications.

Oracles created with Oracle Factory can be showcased in a dedicated
[gallery](https://oracle-factory.iex.ec/gallery), allowing for broader
accessibility and application.

With its cross-chain functionality, extending from the iExec Sidechain to
networks like Ethereum and Polygon, Oracle Factory demonstrates remarkable
versatility. It is a critical tool for developers looking to bridge the gap
between blockchain and the real world, democratizing access to reliable data for
DApps.
