# üîç Find iApps to Use

Discovering the right iApp for your needs is the first step toward secure, privacy-preserving computation. Here are several ways to find and explore available iApps on the iExec network.

## Using the iExec Explorer

The [iExec Explorer](https://explorer.iex.ec) is the primary tool for discovering iApps.

### Step-by-Step Discovery

1. **Visit the Explorer**: Go to [explorer.iex.ec](https://explorer.iex.ec)
2. **Navigate to Apps**: Click on the "Apps" section in the navigation
3. **Search by Name**: Use the search function to find specific applications
4. **View Details**: Click on any app to see detailed information

### What to Look For

When evaluating an iApp, check these key details:

- **Description**: What does the app do?
- **Requirements**: What type of data or inputs does it need?
- **Pricing**: How much does execution cost?
- **Developer**: Who created the app?
- **Usage Statistics**: How often is it used?
- **Orders Availability**: Are there active orders available for execution?

## Using the iExec CLI

For developers who prefer command-line tools, the iExec CLI provides programmatic access to app discovery.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @iexec/iexec
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Note: Use the iExec Explorer for discovering applications
# The CLI is primarily for executing applications, not listing them

# Get detailed information about a specific app (if you have the address)
iexec app show <app-address>
```

## Popular iApp Categories

### Communication Apps
- **Web3Mail**: Send encrypted emails without seeing recipient addresses

- **Data Feeds**: Update external systems with private data

### AI and Machine Learning
- **Model Training**: Train AI models on protected datasets
- **Inference Services**: Run AI inference on sensitive data

## Evaluating App Quality

Before using an iApp, consider these factors:

### Reliability
- **Usage History**: How many times has the app been executed?
- **Success Rate**: What percentage of executions succeed?
- **Developer Reputation**: Is the developer known and trusted?

### Cost Efficiency
- **Execution Cost**: Is the price reasonable for the computation?
- **Competitive Pricing**: How does it compare to similar apps?

## Community Resources

### Discord Community
Join the [iExec Discord](https://discord.gg/iexec) to:
- Ask questions about specific apps
- Get recommendations from other users
- Learn about new apps and updates

### GitHub Repositories
Many iApp developers share their code on GitHub:
- Review the source code
- Check for recent updates
- Report issues or suggest improvements

### Documentation
- **App-Specific Docs**: Check if the developer provides detailed documentation
- **Community Guides**: Look for tutorials and guides from the community

## Next Steps

Once you've found an iApp that meets your needs:

1. **Read the Documentation**: Understand how to use the app properly
2. **Check Requirements**: Ensure you have the necessary data and permissions
3. **Test with Small Data**: Start with a small test before processing large datasets
4. **Monitor Execution**: Track your first few executions to ensure everything works as expected
