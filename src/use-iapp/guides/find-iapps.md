# 🔍 Find iApps to Use

Discovering the right iApp for your needs is the first step toward secure,
privacy-preserving computation. Here are several ways to find and explore
available iApps on the iExec network.

## Using the iExec Explorer

The [iExec Explorer](/overview/tooling-and-explorers/iexec-explorer) is the primary tool for
discovering iApps. For detailed instructions on how to browse and filter iApps, see the [📱 iApps Listing section](/overview/tooling-and-explorers/iexec-explorer#📱-iapps-listing).

### What to Look For

When evaluating an iApp, check these key details:

- **Pricing**: How much does execution cost?
- **Developer**: Who created the app?
- **Usage Statistics**: How often is it used?
- **Orders Availability**: Are there active orders available for execution?

> **Note**: Detailed descriptions and specific requirements are not available in the iExec explorer. You may need to check the developer's documentation, community forums, or contact the developer directly for this information.

## Using the iExec CLI

For developers who prefer command-line tools, the iExec CLI provides
programmatic access to app discovery.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Note: Use the iExec Explorer for discovering applications
# The CLI is primarily for executing applications, not listing them

# Get detailed information about a specific app (if you have the address)
iexec app show <app-address>
```

## Evaluating App Quality

Before using an iApp, consider these factors:

### Reliability

- **Usage History**: How many times has the app been executed?
- **Success Rate**: What percentage of executions succeed?
- **Developer Reputation**: Is the developer known and trusted?

### Cost Efficiency

- **Execution Cost**: Is the price reasonable for the computation?
- **Competitive Pricing**: How does it compare to similar apps?

## Community Resources

### Discord Community

Join the [iExec Discord](https://discord.gg/iexec) to:

- Ask questions about specific apps
- Get recommendations from other users
- Learn about new apps and updates

### GitHub Repositories

Many iApp developers share their code on GitHub:

- Review the source code
- Check for recent updates
- Report issues or suggest improvements

### Documentation

- **App-Specific Docs**: Check if the developer provides detailed documentation
- **Community Guides**: Look for tutorials and guides from the community

## Next Steps

Once you've found an iApp that meets your needs:

1. **Read the Documentation**: Understand how to use the app properly
2. **Check Requirements**: Ensure you have the necessary data and permissions
3. **Test with Small Data**: Start with a small test before processing large
   datasets
4. **Monitor Execution**: Track your first few executions to ensure everything
   works as expected
