# Proof of Contribution

> PoCo is a protocol designed to provide trust in an open and decentralized
> environment of untrusted machines.

The iExec platform provides a network where application providers, workers, and
users can gather and work together. The fully decentralized nature of iExec
implies that the system trusts no single agent by default, and that those agents
require incentives to contribute correctly.

In this context, Proof-of-Contribution (PoCo) is the protocol that iExec uses
for consensus over off-chain computing.

## Protocol

### Objectives

PoCo is a protocol that provides trust in an open and decentralized environment
of untrusted machines.

In addition to providing trust, PoCo also orchestrates the different
contributions to the iExec network and ensures payments are always fair and
timely.

A major quality of PoCo is its modular design. It comes with features that are
context-specific.

### Result consolidation

PoCo relies on replication to achieve result consolidation. This is purely a
software solution that enforces a confidence level on the result.
[The requester can customize this confidence level.](proof-of-contribution.md#replication-and-trust)

This layer also supports the onchain consolidation of execution results that
Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) such as Intel SGX carry out.

### Secure payment

Once the iExec Marketplace seals a deal, the system locks requester funds to
ensure all resource providers receive payment for their contributions. Resources
can take the form of data, applications or computing power.

Workers must achieve consensus on the execution result to get the requester’s
funds. If consensus is not achieved, the system reimburses the requester.

Worker and scheduler must stake RLC to participate as computing providers. Bad
behaviour from an actor results in a loss of stake.

This is essential on the public blockchain, but you can set all values to 0 for
private blockchain networks.

### Permissioning

For an execution to happen, the different parties involved must sign a deal. A
permission mechanism controls access to applications, datasets and worker pools.

You can disable the secure payment layer for a private blockchain, or you can
also use it in the context of the public blockchain to increase security. An
example of permissioning is dataset restriction for a specific application.

### Overview

PoCo describes the succession of contributions that you need to achieve
consensus on a given result. Two blog articles detail its logic:

- [PoCo series #1: Initial PoCo description](https://medium.com/iex-ec/about-trust-and-agents-incentives-4651c138974c)
- [PoCo series #3: Updated PoCo description](https://medium.com/iex-ec/poco-series-3-poco-protocole-update-a2c8f8f30126)

The
[nominal workflow](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-doc/raw/master/techreport/nominalworkflow-ODB.png)
is also available in the [technical report section](/references/glossary)

Below are the details of the implementations:

**1. Deal:**

[The Clerk seals a deal.](proof-of-contribution.md#brokering) This marks the
beginning of the execution. The system creates an event to notify the worker
pool’s scheduler.

The consensus timer starts when the parties sign the deal. The corresponding
task must complete before the end of this countdown. Otherwise, the scheduler
gets punished by a loss of stake and reputation, and the system reimburses the
user.

**2. Initialization:**

The scheduler calls the `initialize` method. Given a deal id and a position in
the request order (within the deal window), this function initializes the
corresponding task and returns the
_taskid_.`bytes32 taskid = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_dealid, idx));`

**3. Authorization signature:**

The scheduler designates workers that participate in this task. The scheduler’s
Ethereum wallet signs a message containing the worker’s Ethereum address, the
taskid, and (optionally) the Ethereum address of the worker's enclave. If the
worker doesn't use an enclave, you must fill this field with `address(0)`.

This Ethereum signature (authorization) goes to the worker through an off-chain
channel implemented by the middleware.

**4. Task computation:**

Once the worker receives and verifies the authorization, the worker computes the
requested tasks. Results from this execution go in the `/iexec_out` folder. The
following values are then computed:

- _bytes32 digest_: a digest (sha256) of the result folder.
- _bytes32 hash_: the hash of the _digest_, that produces consensus
- _bytes32 seal_: the salted hash of the _digest_, that proves a worker’s knew
  the _digest_ value before publishing it.
  `resultHash == keccak256(abi.encodePacked( taskid, resultDigest))`
  `resultSeal == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(worker, taskid, resultDigest))`

In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a
particular input, will always produce the same output.

Both the `digest`, the `hash` and the `seal` compute automatically based on the
output of the application. If the output is not entirely deterministic, then the
application can specify a deterministic file that should use for building
consensus. In order to do so, the application just has to provide the path to
the deterministic file using a specific entry `deterministic-output-path` in
`${IEXEC_OUT}/computed.json`.

Alternatively, if you use the application in an oracle context (the results are
designed to process on-chain by receiver smart-contracts), then the value of
this callback must specify the value of in `${IEXEC_OUT}/computed.json` under
the entry `callback-data`.

If a TEE produces the result, the post-processing enclave will automatically
produce an `enclave-signature` entry that contains the enclave signature (of the
resultHash and resultSeal). TEE certification of results is transparent to the
application developer.

**5. Contribution:**

Once the worker performs the execution, the worker pushes its contribution using
the `contribute` method. The contribution contains:

- _bytes32 taskid_
- _bytes32 resultHash_
- _bytes32 resultSeal_
- _address enclaveChallenge_

The address of the enclave (specified in the scheduler’s authorization). If no
enclave specifies, you should set this parameter to `address(0)`.

- _bytes enclaveSign_

The enclave signature. You need this if the `enclaveChallenge` is not
`address(0)`. Otherwise, you should set it to the empty byte string `0x`.

- _bytes workerpoolSign_

The scheduler computes the signature at step 2.

**6. Consensus:**

During the contribution, the system updates and verifies the consensus.
Contributions are possible until the system reaches consensus, at which point
the contributions close. The system then enters a 2h reveal phase.

**7. Reveal:**

During the reveal phase, workers that have contributed to the consensus must
call the `reveal` method with the `resultDigest`. This verification confirms
that the `resultHash` and `resultSeal` they provided are valid. Failure to
reveal is equivalent to a bad contribution, and results in a loss of stake and
reputation.

**8. Finalize:**

Once the system reveals all contributions, or at the end of the reveal period if
some (but not all) reveals are missing, the scheduler must call the `finalize`
method. This task finalization, rewards good contribution and punishes bad ones.
You must call this before the end of the consensus timer.

### Staking and Payment

Among the objectives of PoCo, the protocol ensures a worker that contributes
correctly receives a reward and, at the same time, that a requester won’t pay
unless the system achieves consensus. This locking achieves the requester’s
funds for the duration of the consensus, and unlocking them depending on the
outcome.

Staking prevents bad behavior and encourage good contributions.

Your account, managed by the `Escrow` part of the `IexecClerk`, separates
between `balance.stake` (available, can be withdrawn) and `balance.locked`
(unavailable, frozen by a running task). The `Escrow` exposes the following
mechanism:

`lock`: Moves value from the `balance.stake` to `balance.lock`

- Locks the requester stake for payment
- Locks the scheduler stake to protect against failed consensus
- Locks the worker stake when making a contribution

`unlock`: Moves value from the `balance.lock` back to the `balance.stake`

- Unlock the requester stake when consensus fails
- Unlock the scheduler stake when the system achieves consensus
- Unlock the worker stake when they contributed to a successful consensus

`seize`: Confiscate value from `balance.lock`

- Seize the requester stake when the system achieves consensus (payment)
- Seize the scheduler stake when consensus fails (send to the reward kitty)
- Seize the worker stake when a contribution fails (redistributed to the other
  workers in the task)

`reward`: Award value to the `balance.stake`

- Reward the scheduler when the system achieves consensus
- Reward the worker when they contributed to a successful consensus
- Reward the app and dataset owner

The requester payment consists of 3 parts, one for the worker pool, one for the
application and one for the dataset. When a consensus finalizes, the payment
seizes from the requester and the application and dataset owners are rewarded
accordingly. The worker pool part puts inside the `totalReward`. Stake from the
losing workers also adds to the `totalReward`. The scheduler takes a fixed
portion of the `totalReward` as defined in the worker pool smart contract
(`schedulerRewardRatioPolicy`).

The remaining reward is then divided between the successful workers
proportionally to the impact their contribution made on the consensus. If there
is anything left (division rounding, a few nRLC at most) the scheduler gets it.
The scheduler also gets part of the reward kitty.

#### Parameters

`FINAL_DEADLINE_RATIO = 10`, `CONTRIBUTION_DEADLINE_RATIO = 7`,
`REVEAL_DEADLINE_RATIO = 2`

Parameters of the consensus timer. They express the number of reference timers
(category duration) that dedicate to each phase. These settings correspond to a
70%-20%-10% distribution between the contribution phase, the reveal phase and
the finalize phase.

- `FINAL_DEADLINE_RATIO` This describes the total duration of the consensus. At
  the end of this timer the consensus must finalize. If it is not, the user can
  make a claim to get a refund.
- `CONTRIBUTION_DEADLINE_RATIO` This describes the duration of the contribution
  period. The consensus can finalize before that, but no contribution will be
  allowed after the timer to ensure enough time leaves for the reveal and
  finalize steps.
- `REVEAL_DEADLINE_RATIO` This describes the duration of the reveal period.
  Whenever a contribution triggers a consensus, a reveal period of this duration
  reserves for the workers to reveal their contribution. Note that this period
  will necessarily start before the end of the contribution phase.

Let's consider a task of category GigaPlus, which reference duration is 1 hour.
If the task submitted at 9:27AM, the contributions must send before 4:27PM
(16:27). Whenever a contribution triggers a consensus, a 2 hours long reveal
period will start. Whatever happens, the consensus has to achieve by 7:27PM
(19:27).

`WORKERPOOL_STAKE_RATIO = 30`

Percentage of the worker pool price that has to stake by the scheduler. For
example, for a `20 RLC` task, with an additional `1 RLC` for the application and
`5 RLC` for the dataset, the worker will have to lock `26 RLC` in total and the
scheduler will have to lock (stake) `30% * 20 = 6 RLC`.

This stake loses and transferred to the reward kitty if the consensus is not
finalized by the end of the consensus timer.

`KITTY_RATIO = 10`

Percentage of the reward kitty for the scheduler per successful execution. If
the reward kitty contains 42 RLC when a finalize calls, then the scheduler will
get 4.2 extra RLC and the reward kitty will leave with 37.8 RLC.

`KITTY_MIN = 1 RLC`

Minimum reward on successful execution (up to the reward kitty value).

- If the reward kitty contains 42.0 RLC, the reward is 4.2
- If the reward kitty contains 5.0 RLC, the reward should be 0.5 but gets raised
  to 1.0
- If the reward kitty contains 0.7 RLC, the reward should be 0.07 but gets
  raised to 0.7 (the whole kitty)

`reward = kitty.percentage(KITTY_RATIO).max(KITTY_MIN).min(kitty)`

#### Example

Let's consider a worker pool with the policies `workerStakeRatioPolicy = 35%`
and `workerStakeRatioPolicy = 5%`.

- A requester offers `20 RLC` to run a task. The task is free, but it uses a
  dataset that costs `1 RLC`. The requester locks `21 RLC` and the scheduler
  `30% * 20 = 6 RLC`. The trust objective is `99%` (`trust = 100`)
- 3 workers contribute:
  - The first one (`score = 12 → power = 3`) contributes `17`. It has to lock
    `7 RLC` (35% of the `20 RLC` awarded to the worker pool).
  - The second worker (`score = 100 → power = 32`) contributes `42`. It also
    locks `7 RLC`.
  - The third worker (`score = 300 → power = 99`) contributes `42`. It also
    locks `7 RLC`.
- After the third contribution, the value `42` has reached a `99.87%`
  likelihood. Consensus achieves and the two workers who contributed toward `42`
  have to reveal.
- After both workers reveal, the scheduler finalizes the task:
  - The requester locked value of `21 RLC` seizes.
  - The dataset owner gets `1 RLC` for the use of its dataset.
  - Stake from the scheduler unlocks.
  - Stakes from workers 2 and 3 are also unlocked.
  - The first worker stake seizes, and it loses a third of its score. The
    corresponding `7 RLC` add to the `totalReward`.
  - We now have `totalReward = 27 RLC`:
    - We save 5% for the scheduler, `workersReward = 95% * 27 = 25.65 RLC`
    - Worker 2 has weight `log2(32) = 5` and worker 3 has a weight
      `log2(99) = 6`. Total weight is `5+6=11`
    - Worker 2 takes `25.65 * 5/11 = 11.659090909 RLC`
    - Worker 3 takes `25.65 * 6/11 = 13.990909090 RLC`
    - Scheduler takes the remaining `1.350000001 RLC`
  - If the reward kitty is not empty, the scheduler also takes a part of it.

## Replication & Trust

### How to achieve trust ?

The PoCo offers a consensus mechanism that can certify the likelihood of a
result to be valid. This consensus relies on the scoring of workers and the
replication of a task’s execution to combine the score of the workers that come
up with the same result. This consensus is largely based on Sarmenta’s work
[[Sarmenta2002]](proof-of-contribution.md#references) with specific tuning of
the scoring function [[Trust2018]](proof-of-contribution.md#references).

### Contribution credibility

Each worker’s contribution has an associated credibility. This credibility
derives from the worker’s history score. As described in
[[Trust2018]](proof-of-contribution.md#references), a worker score is a positive
integer that increments for each valid and verified contribution. In case of bad
contribution, a worker loses one third of it’s score. This credibility can
express as a likelihood percentage but also as a weight value that can be used
to detect consensus without resorting to floating point arithmetics, more
details in [[Trust2018]](proof-of-contribution.md#references).

### Requiring a trust level

Based on [[Sarmenta2002]](proof-of-contribution.md#references) describing the
way to combine worker’s contribution and to evaluate a result’s likelihood, a
requester can ask for the level of trust as an input for the PoCo processing, to
impose a certain quality of service. The trust level corresponds to a minimum
correctness likelihood that a result must achieve to be valid. For example, a
trust level of 0 means any contribution would accept, regardless of the score of
the worker proposing it. On the other hand a trust level of 99.99% means a
result will only accept if the contribution towards it result shows a
correctness probability higher than 99.99%.

The trust level expresses, on-chain, by an integer `trust` such that
`threshold = 1 - 1 / trust`.

| **Trust** | **PoCo enforced confidence threshold** |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 0         | 0%                                     |
| 1         | 0%                                     |
| 2         | 50%                                    |
| 100       | 99%                                    |
| 10000     | 99.99%                                 |
| 1000000   | 99.9999%                               |

### Limitation

This consensus mechanism requires replicable applications. Non-deterministic
applications, long-running jobs such as webservers, do not meet this requirement
out of the box. When it is possible, the application developer must provide a
deterministic result using the `deterministic-output-path` entry of the
`${IEXEC_OUT}/computed.json` file. Otherwise, the user can still run its
application on the iExec platform but would have to disable the PoCo’s consensus
layer. Hardware security as TEE is an option to overpass this limitation.

## Brokering

### Overview

We studied many possible evolutions of the brokering process. The first
requirement is to include bid orders to complete the already available ask
orders. It soon became clear that the evolution had to go beyond a simple
interaction. We considered on-chain and off-chain approach and finally went for
a solution where both the pairing and the order book are off-chain. It might
sound counterintuitive, but it has many advantages.

If the orders and the pairing handle off-chain, how can we build an on-chain
agreement knowing that all parties have agreed? Is there a threat to the
platform security?

This option relies on the use of cryptographic signatures for order
authentication. We represent orders using structures containing all the required
details. The hash of this structure uniquely identifies the order. The structure
by itself is worthless as anyone could write and publish it. However, if we add
a valid cryptographic signature (of the identifying hash), then the origin of
the order can certify with the same level of security as if it was published
on-chain. This role fulfills a smart-contract called the iExecClerk.

An overview of the iExecODB (Open Decentralized Brokering) is available in this
blog article:

- [PoCo series #5: Open decentralized brokering on the iExec platform](https://medium.com/iex-ec/poco-series-5-open-decentralized-brokering-on-the-iexec-platform-67b266e330d8)

### Orders structure

As discussed earlier, iExec introduces the offchain signature of orders as a new
core element of the iExec Open Decentralized Brokering, the iExec Clerk should
match these orders. There are 4 types of orders corresponding to the 4 actors
involved: the worker pool, the application, the dataset and the requester. Each
order types has to follow a specific structure and uses

## Tag

The tag specifies the need or the availability of features that go beyond the
specifications of the category. The tag is a requirement when it is part of an
app order, a dataset order or a requester order. On the other hand, the tag in
the workerpool order expresses the availability of the corresponding features.

In V3, tags are 32 bytes (256 bits) long array where each bit corresponds to a
feature.

For orders matching, the worker pool order must enable all bits that enable in
any of the app order, dataset order and requester order. Meaning that if the app
order tag is `0x12 = 0x10 | 0x02`, the dataset order is `0x81 = 0x80 | 0x01` and
the requester order is `0x03 = 0x02 | 0x01`, then the worker pool order must, at
least, have a tag `0x93 = 0x80 | 0x10 | 0x02 | 0x01`.

### Matching Conditions

In order to trigger an execution, a deal must register by the iExec Clerk. Deals
are formed when orders are successfully matched by the clerk. A match requires 3
or 4 orders depending on the requester requirements, the dataset order is
optional.

Orders compatibility required:

**1. The worker pool’s category and the requester’s category must be equal.**

```text
require(_requestorder.category == _workerpoolorder.category);
```

**2. The worker pool’s trust must be greater or equal to the requester’s
trust.**

```text
require(_requestorder.trust == _workerpoolorder.trust);
```

**3. The app’s, dataset’s and worker pool’s prices must be less or equal to the
requester’s appmaxprice, datasetmaxprice and workerpoolmaxprice.**

```text
require(_requestorder.appmaxprice >= _apporder.appprice);
require(_requestorder.datasetmaxprice >= _datasetorder.datasetprice);
require(_requestorder.workerpoolmaxprice >= _workerpoolorder.workerpoolprice);
```

**4. The worker pool’s tag must enable all the features required by the app’s
tag, the dataset’s tag and the worker pool’s tag.**

```text
require(tag & ~_workerpoolorder.tag == 0x0);
require(tag & ~_workerpoolorder.tag == 0x0);
```

**5. If TEE tag requires, then application must be TEE compatible.**

```text
require((tag ^ _apporder.tag)[31] & 0x01 == 0x0);
```

**6. The app provided by the apporder must match the one required by the
requester.**

```text
require(_requestorder.app == _apporder.app);
```

**7. The dataset provided by the datasetorder must match the one required by the
requester.**

```text
require(_requestorder.dataset == _datasetorder.dataset);
```

**8. If the requester specified a worker pool restriction, the worker pool must
match this value or be part of the corresponding group.**

```text
require(_checkIdentity(_requestorder.workerpool, _workerpoolorder.workerpool, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
```

**9. The application must fit the dataset’s and the worker pool’s application
restrictions (if any).**

```text
require(_checkIdentity(_datasetorder.apprestrict, _apporder.app, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
require(_checkIdentity(_workerpoolorder.apprestrict, _apporder.app, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
```

**10. The dataset must fit the application’s and the worker pool’s restrictions
(if any).**

```text
require(_checkIdentity(_apporder.datasetrestrict, _datasetorder.dataset, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
require(_checkIdentity(_workerpoolorder.datasetrestrict, _datasetorder.dataset, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
```

**11. The worker pool must fit the application’s and the dataset’s restrictions
(if any).**

```text
require(_checkIdentity(_apporder.workerpoolrestrict, _workerpoolorder.workerpool, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
require(_checkIdentity(_datasetorder.workerpoolrestrict, _workerpoolorder.workerpool, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
```

**12. The requester must fit the application’s, the dataset’s and the worker
pool’s restrictions (if any).**

```text
require(_checkIdentity(_apporder.requesterrestrict, _requestorder.requester, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
require(_checkIdentity(_datasetorder.requesterrestrict, _requestorder.requester, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
require(_checkIdentity(_workerpoolorder.requesterrestrict, _requestorder.requester, GROUPMEMBER_PURPOSE));
```

**13. All resources must register in the corresponding registries.**

```text
require(m_appregistry.isRegistered(_apporder.app));
require(m_datasetregistry.isRegistered(_datasetorder.dataset));
require(m_workerpoolregistry.isRegistered(_workerpoolorder.workerpool));
```

**14. All orders must sign or presigned.**

```text
require(_checkPresignatureOrSignature(App(_apporder.app).m_owner(), _apporder.hash(), _apporder.sign));

require(_checkPresignatureOrSignature(Workerpool(_workerpoolorder.workerpool).m_owner(), _workerpoolorder.hash(), _workerpoolorder.sign));
require(_checkPresignatureOrSignature(_requestorder.requester, _requestorder.hash(), _requestorder.sign));
```

**15. The deal produced must contain at least one task.**

**16. Requester and worker pool must be able to stake.**

### FAQ : How to write an order ?

**[Requester] How do I enable PoCo’s consolidation of results?**

A requester can enable the trust layer of the PoCo by setting the trust value in
the requestorder. As described here, the trust defines with the required
confidence level. If the requester wants à 99.99% confidence level on the
results, it must set the `trust` field to `10000`.

**[Requester] How do I run a non deterministic application despite requiring
determinism?**

The PoCo requires an application to be deterministic for the replication layer
to provide trust in the result. If an application is not deterministic,
consensus cannot achieve and replication is not necessary.

In order to obtain a result, the requester must prevent replication by asking a
`trust` value of `0`. To protect your result, the requester can ask to run in an
enclave by setting the `tag` to `0x1`.

**[Requester] How do I protect my result using encryption?**

The result of an execution can be valuable to the end user, and the requester
might want to protect this result from leaking with encryption.

Anyone can set up an encryption key in an SMS (Secret Management Service) of its
choice and set up the SMS address in the directory.

Once a user set an encryption key (see TODO), any computation result can be
encrypted with, you have to set up the beneficiary address in the
RequesterOrder.

An application can only perform result encryption inside an enclave. No
encryption key provides the SMS to an application that doesn't run outside an
enclave.

**[Dataset owner] How do I limit the usage of my dataset to a specific
application?**

iExec’s Data wallet and Data store is a complete solution to monetize valuable
datasets preserving privacy. Before uploading a dataset you should encrypt it
using the iExec SDK. Through this process, the encryption key becomes the
valuable data that needs protection.

The encryption key must store in an SMS and the address of the corresponding SMS
recorded in the directory. The SMS stores this encryption key and will only
communicate it to an application running in an enclave.

Before a worker runs this application, the worker must first prove that its
access is legitimate by providing the scheduler authorization. The SMS will
verify that this authorization’s signature is valid and that the corresponding
task registers onchain. This means that any deal signed in the iExec Clerk will
grant access to the dataset’s encryption key.

Therefore, in order to restrict the dataset’s usage, the dataset owner should
set up restriction before signing a brokering order. This happens through the
`apprestrict` field of the datasetorder. The dataset owner can deploy a
`SimpleGroup` smart contract, have the `apprestrict` field point to it, and then
whitelisting the applications that will have access to the dataset’s encryption
key.

**[Scheduler] How do I protect myself from non-deterministic applications?**

When a scheduler publishes an order, it makes a commitment to achieve consensus
on any task that is part of a deal made. While everything happens to ensure an
application cannot hurt a worker pool’s machines, not reaching the consensus
would cause a loss of stake for the scheduler. The scheduler must therefore take
action to prevent this.

Whenever the scheduler proposes to certify a result using the PoCo’s trust
layer, it should make sure the application’s developer took the actions required
to make it compatible with the PoCo. On the other hand, any application could be
executed with the PoCo’s trust layer disabled.

A scheduler could therefore emit two kinds of workerpoolorder:

- A workerpoolorder offering execution with the PoCo’s trust layer disabled
  (`trust = 0`) and accepting all applications (`apprestrict = 0`)
- A workerpoolorder offering secure execution of whitelisted tasks. The
  application whitelist would use the `GroupInterface` to verify by the iExec
  Clerk. This group could either manage the scheduler or by a certification
  authority that would check application's determinism.

## Other technical choices

### Callback

Some requesters might want an onchain callback with the result of the execution.
The callback mechanism uses [[EIP-1154]](proof-of-contribution.md#references-1).
The result is a `bytes` value that is set during the `finalize`. The
`IexecProxy` implements both side of the
[[EIP-1154]](proof-of-contribution.md#references-1).

**Pull:**

Results identify by their `taskid` and can pull through the `resultFor` method.

**Push:**

In order to use the push approach, the requester can use the `callback` field to
specify the address of a smart contract that implements the `receiveResult`
method specified in [[EIP-1154]](proof-of-contribution.md#references-1). This
method calls during the finalization with a minimum of 200000 nanoRLC gas to
proceed [[*]](proof-of-contribution.md#references-1).

In order to protect the scheduler and the workers, any error raised during this
callback ignores and will not prevent the finalization from happening. The same
mechanism goes for the callback running out of gas.

### Consensus & Reveal duration

When orders match, IexecClerk records the deal which details the parameters of
the task. If a consensus on a result achieves before the countdown, the task is
successful. After the countdown, as no consensus reaches, the execution is
failed. The duration of the consensus timer is a balance between the quality of
service offered to the requester (short timer) and the margin available for the
scheduler and the worker to achieve consensus (and go through the reveal
process).

The maximum duration of a task governs the category the task fits in. While the
consensus duration can obviously not be shorter than the task runtime, a
significant margin requires for the scheduler to do its job correctly. Multiple
workers are likely to contribute and extra time must plan for the revealing and
finalization steps.

The consensus timer starts when the deal records the IexecClerk.

In case of failure, the requester can claim the refund.

In the v3-alpha version, this timer lasts for 10 category runtime, for all
category. The reveal timer starts whenever a consensus reaches and determines
the time frame the workers have to reveal their contributions. This should be
long enough for worker to have time to reveal while not being too long so that
the requester waits too long for its result or the consensus fails because the
scheduler cannot finalize in time. In the v3-alpha version, this timer lasts for
2 runtime whatever the category runtime. This leaves a gap of at least 1 time
the category runtime for the scheduler to finalize the task.

### Reward kitty

When a consensus fails, the requester gets a refund and the scheduler loses its
stake. In order to remove an attack vector, the requester does not get any of
the seized stake. If this was a feature, anyone could build a flawed application
that would not reach consensus to drain money from the scheduler. This would
force the scheduler to whitelist all applications thus reducing the usability of
the platform. Seized stake from the scheduler goes into a specific account
called the _reward kitty_. No one controls this account, nor can withdraw from
it. However, the tokens are not burned. Whenever a task finalizes, the scheduler
that organized the execution of this task receives a reward by the requester and
also gets a small part of the reward kitty.

As described in the protocol parameters section, this reward is
`reward = kitty.percentage(KITTY_RATIO).max(KITTY_MIN).min(kitty)`.
