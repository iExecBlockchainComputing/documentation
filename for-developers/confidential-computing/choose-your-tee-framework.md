# Choose your TEE framework

Before going any further, make sure you managed to [Build your first application](../your-first-app.md).

After understanding the fundamentals of Confidential Computing and explaining the technologies behind it, it is time to roll up our sleeves and get hands-on with [enclaves](intel-sgx-technology.md#enclave). In this guide, we will focus on protecting an application - that is already compatible with the iExec platform - using SGX, and without changing the source code. That means we will use the same code we [previously](../your-first-app.md#build-your-app) deployed for a basic iExec application.

Two TEE frameworks are supported on the iExec platform:

- Scone
- Gramine

## Scone

At a high-level, Scone protects the confidentiality and integrity of the data and the code without needing to modify or recompile the application. With native Intel® SGX technology, the OS is not a part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) hence system calls and kernel services are not available from an Intel® SGX. enclave. This can be limiting as the application will not be able to use File System and sockets directly from the code running inside the enclave. The [Scone](https://scontain.com/) framework resolves this, and reduce the burden of porting the application to Intel® SGX.

More precisely, Scone provides a C standard library interface to container processes. System calls are executed outside of the enclave, but they are shielded by transparently encrypting/decrypting application data. Files stored outside of the enclave are therefore encrypted, and network communication is protected by transport layer security (TLS).

For a deeper understanding, you can have a look to the official [Scone documentation](https://sconedocs.github.io/).

## Gramine

Gramine is able to run unmodified applications inside SGX enclaves, without the toll of manually porting the application to the SGX environment.

For a deeper understanding, you can have a look to the official [Gramine documentation](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/).
