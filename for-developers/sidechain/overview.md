# iExec sidechain
iExec sidechain, aka **Bellecour**, is a Proof of Authority Blockchain that aims at scaling the underling infrastructure of iExec's off-chain/confidential computing platform. It is linked to Ethereum Mainnet with a bridge that enables sending [RLC](https://iex.ec/rlc-token/) tokens in both directions.

## Key features & highlights
* **EVM-compatibility**: Bellecour is an EVM-compatible chain so there is no need to modify contracts in order to deploy them the sidechain.
* **Block time**: a block is sealed every 5 seconds which is, on average 3 times faster than Ethereum Mainnet.
* **Block size**: `6,700,000` gas limit per block.
* **Gas price**: No transaction fees are applied.

## Validators
Currently, the Sidechain is running with 8 validators, some of them are not controlled by iExec which makes the chain more decentralized and resilient.
The governance of the chain is managed through ballots and votes.

## Whitelisting
By default, all operations related to iExec's Marketplace such as deploying Dapps/Datasets/Workerpools and running tasks are permissable without any authorization. However, developers who want to deploy custom Smart Contracts need to send a whitelisting request using the following [link](https://iexecproject.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/9/create/66).

## Bridge
Tasks on iExec's off-chain/confidential computing marketplace are paid with ERC20 RLC tokens. Users wanting to interact with the platform need to bridge RLC tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to the Sidechain.

Tokens on the Sidechain are directly linked to RLC token on Ethereum Mainnet. No new tokens are created on the Sidechain without locking the equivalent on Mainnet.
The bridging operation follows the **lock & mint / burn & unlock** principle. When sending tokens from Mainnet to Bellecour, the bridge **locks** the initial amount on the source chain and **mints** the equivalent on the destination chain. When going in the other direction, it **burns** tokens on the Sidechain and **unlocks** the same amount on Mainnet. The bridged asset is called xRLC on Bellecour.

```
1 RLC = 1 xRLC
```
It is to be noted that `RLC` is an ERC-20 token on mainnet while `xRLC` is the native token of the Sidechain.

Users can send tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to the iExec Sidechain or vice-versa using the **Account Manager** available across all iExec products.
