## Understand what is an iExec decentralized application?

iExec leverage [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) containers to ensure the execution of your application on a decentralized infrastructure. iExec supports Linux-based docker images.

### Why using Docker containers?

* Docker Engine is the most **widely used** container engine. 
* A Docker container image is a **standard** unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. This allows for computations to be **run on any worker** connected to the decentralized infrastructure.
* Docker also enables the creation of new layers on top of existing images. This allows for any iExec **apps to be easily built on top of existing docker images**.

### What kind of application can I build on iExec?

Today you can run any application as a task. This means services are not supported for now.

## Application I/O

This is an overview of an iExec application inputs and expected outputs. You probably don't have to deeply understand every part of this section to build your app, just pick what you need.

### Application args

The requester may specify the arguments to use with an application in the requestorder, these arguments are forwarded as they are, straight to the application.

### Application input files

Your app may use input files, all the input files specified by the requester will be downloaded in the container directory `/iexec_in` before running your application.

#### Input files \(public\):

Input files contain non-sensitive data publicly available on the Internet. The requester may specify any number of input files in the requestorder.

For each input file, the variable `IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_x` is set to the file name \(`x` is the index of the file starting with `1`\). The total number of input files is stored in the variable.

Use these variables in your application to find input files to process. \(first input file path is `/iexec_in/$IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_1`\)

#### Confidential input files \(datasets\):

Confidential datasets are encrypted files available only in a Trusted Execution Environment \(TEE\). You will learn how to deal with datasets in the next tutorial.

A single dataset file is currently supported.

### Runtime variables

The runtime variables are environment variables set by the iExec worker and available for your application.

#### Input files variables

Use these variables if your app deals with input files

| Name | Type | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IEXEC\_INPUT\_FILES\_FOLDER | path | Absolute path of iexec input folder \(`/iexec_in/`\) |
| IEXEC\_NB\_INPUT\_FILES | int &gt;= 0 | Total number of input files |
| IEXEC\_INPUT\_FILE\_NAME\_x | string or unset | Name of the input file indexed by x \(`x` starts with `1`\) |

#### Bag of Tasks variables

The requester may request multiple tasks in a single transaction \(Bag of Tasks\), each task of the bag is given a unique index. If you intend to support running Bag of Tasks in your app, you can use the following variables to index tasks in parallelization use cases.

| Name | Type | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IEXEC\_BOT\_TASK\_INDEX | int &gt;= 0 | Index of the current task |
| IEXEC\_BOT\_FIRST\_INDEX | int &gt;= 0 | Index of the first task in the current Deal \(Bag of task subset\) |
| IEXEC\_BOT\_SIZE | int &gt;= 1 | Total number of parallelized tasks in a Bag of Tasks |

### Application outputs

An iExec app produces a `result.zip` file for the requester with the following tree:

```text
result.zip
  ├── iexec_out/
  └── stdout.txt
```

`stdout.txt` contains the logs of your application. This file is automatically generated by the iExec worker.

`iexec_out` is a copy at the final state of your app container directory `/iexec_out/` final state, your application must create the following files in `/iexec_out/` :

* `/iexec_out/computed.json` file should be created when your computing is over. It contains at least a field `deterministic-output-path` which is the path of the deterministic portion of your results. It should be either a file or a non-empty folder. It is required for the proof of execution \(given the same inputs this file should always be the same\).
* If your app produces output files, you must copy them in `/iexec_out/` .

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your application must always create a `computed.json` file in `/iexec_out` as a proof of execution which could look like `{ "deterministic-output-path" : "/iexec_out/result.txt" }`

The `computed.json`file is compared across replicated tasks in the [Proof of Contribution protocol](../key-concepts/proof-of-contribution.md) to achieve a consensus on workers.
{% endhint %}

## Build your app

Create the folder tree for your application in `~/iexec-projects/`.

```text
cd ~/iexec-projects
mkdir my-hello-world-app
cd my-hello-world-app
mkdir src
touch Dockerfile
```

### Write the app \(JavaScript script example\)

The following examples only feature Javascript and Python use cases for simplicity concerns but remember that you can run on iExec anything which is Dockerizable.

**Copy the following content** in `src/` .

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
{% code title="src/app.js" %}
```javascript
const fsPromises = require('fs').promises;
const figlet = require('figlet');

(async () => {
  try {
    const iexecOut = process.env.IEXEC_OUT;
    // Do whatever you want (let's write hello world here)
    const message = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 'World';

    const text = figlet.textSync(`Hello, ${message}!`); // Let's add some art for e.g.
    console.log(text);
    // Append some results in /iexec_out/
    await fsPromises.writeFile(`${iexecOut}/result.txt`, text);
    // Declare everything is computed
    const computedJsonObj = {
      'deterministic-output-path': `${iexecOut}/result.txt`,
    };
    await fsPromises.writeFile(
      `${iexecOut}/computed.json`,
      JSON.stringify(computedJsonObj),
    );
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  }
})();
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
{% code title="src/app.py" %}
```python
import os
import sys
import json
from pyfiglet import Figlet

iexec_in = os.environ['IEXEC_IN']
iexec_out = os.environ['IEXEC_OUT']

# Do whatever you want (let's write hello world here)
text = 'Hello, {}!'.format(sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "World")
text = Figlet().renderText(text) # Let's add some art for e.g.
print(text)

# Append some results in /iexec_out/
with open(iexec_out + '/result.txt', 'w+') as fout:
    fout.write(text)

# Declare everything is computed
with open(iexec_out + '/computed.json', 'w+') as f:
    json.dump({ "deterministic-output-path" : iexec_out + '/result.txt' }, f)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Dockerize your app

**Copy the following content** in `Dockerfile` .

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
{% code title="Dockerfile" %}
```bash
FROM node:10
### install your dependencies if you have some
RUN mkdir /app && cd /app && npm install figlet@1.x
COPY ./src /app
ENTRYPOINT [ "node", "/app/app.js"]
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
{% code title="Dockerfile" %}
```bash
FROM python:3.7.3-alpine3.10
### install python dependencies if you have some
RUN pip3 install pyfiglet
COPY ./src /app
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Build the docker image.

```text
docker build . --tag my-hello-world
```

{% hint style="success" %}
`docker build` produce an image id, using `--tag <name>` option is a convenient way to name the image to reuse it in the next steps.
{% endhint %}

Congratulation you built your first docker image for iExec!

## Test your app locally

### Basic test

Run your application locally \(container volumes bound with local volumes\).

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v /tmp/iexec_in:/iexec_in \
    -v /tmp/iexec_out:/iexec_out \
    -e IEXEC_IN=/iexec_in \
    -e IEXEC_OUT=/iexec_out \
    my-hello-world arg1 arg2 arg3
```

{% hint style="success" %}
docker run \[options\] image \[args\]

**docker run usage:**

`docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARGS...]`

Use `[COMMAND]` and `[ARGS...]` to simulate the requester arguments

**useful options for iExec:**

`-v` : Bind mount a volume. Use it to bind `/iexec_in` and `/iexec_out`

`-e`: Set environnement variable. Use it to simulate iExec Runtime variables
{% endhint %}

### Test with input files

Starting with the basic test you can simulate input files.

For each input file:

* Copy it in the local volume bound to `/iexec_in` .
* Add `-e IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_x=NAME` to docker run options \(`x` is the index of the file starting by 1 and `NAME` is the name of the file\)

Add `-e IEXEC_NB_INPUT_FILES=n` to docker run options \(`n` is the total number of input files\).

Example with two inputs files:

```text
touch /tmp/iexec_in/file1 && \
touch /tmp/iexec_in/file2 && \
docker run \
    -v /tmp/iexec_in:/iexec_in \
    -v /tmp/iexec_out:/iexec_out \
    -e IEXEC_IN=/iexec_in \
    -e IEXEC_OUT=/iexec_out \
    -e IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_1=file1 \
    -e IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_2=file2 \
    -e IEXEC_NB_INPUT_FILES=2 \
    my-hello-world \
    arg1 arg2 arg3
```

## Test your app on iExec

### Push your app to Dockerhub

Login to your Dockerhub account.

```text
docker login
```

Tag your application image to push it to your dockerhub public repository.

```text
docker tag my-hello-world <dockerusername>/my-hello-world:1.0.0
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
replace `<dockerusername>` with your docker user name
{% endhint %}

Push the image to Dockerhub.

```text
docker push <dockerusername>/my-hello-world:1.0.0
```

**Congratulation, you app is ready to be deployed on iExec!**

### Deploy your app on iExec

You already learned how to deploy the default app on iExec in the [previous tutorial](quick-start-for-developers.md).

Go back to the `iexec-project` folder.

```text
cd ~/iexec-projects/
```

You will need a few configurations in `iexec.json` to deploy your app:

* Replace app **name** with your application name \(display only\)
* Replace app **multiaddr** with your app image download URI \(should looks like `registry.hub.docker.com/<dockerusername>/my-hello-world:1.0.0`\)
* Replace app **checksum** with your application image checksum \(see tip below\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The checksum of your app is the sha256 digest of the docker image prefixed with `0x` , you can use the following command to get it.

```text
docker pull <dockerusername>/my-hello-world:1.0.0 | grep "Digest: sha256:" | sed 's/.*sha256:/0x/'
```
{% endhint %}

Deploy your app on iExec

```text
iexec app deploy --chain goerli
```

Verify the deployed app \(name, multiaddr, checksum, owner\)

```text
iexec app show --chain goerli
```

### Run your app on iExec

Before requesting an execution make sure your account stake is charged with Goerli RLC

```text
iexec account show --chain goerli
```

Run your application on iExec

```text
iexec app run --watch --chain goerli
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Using arguments:**

You can pass arguments to the app using `--args <args>` option.

With `--args "dostuff --with-option"` the app will receive `["dostuff", "--with-option"]` as process args.

**Using input files:**

You can pass input files to the app using `--input-files <list of URL>` option.

With `--input-files https://example.com/file-A.txt,https://example.com/file-B.zip` the iExec worker will download the files before running the app in `IEXEC_INPUT_FILES_FOLDER`, and let the app access them throug variables:

* `file-A.txt` as`IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_1`
* `file-B.zip` as`IEXEC_INPUT_FILE_NAME_2`
{% endhint %}

Once the run is completed copy the taskid from `iexec app run` output to download and check the result

```text
iexec task show <taskid> --download my-app-result --chain goerli  \
    && unzip my-app-result.zip -d my-app-result
```

Congratulation your app successfully ran on iExec!

## Publish your app on iExec marketplace

```text
iexec app publish --chain goerli
```

**Congratulation your application is now available on iExec!**
