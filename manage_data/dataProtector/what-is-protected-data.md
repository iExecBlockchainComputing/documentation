# ‚ùì What Is Protected Data?

Protected Data is iExec's revolutionary approach to data privacy and ownership. It allows you to maintain control over your data while enabling computation on it without exposing the raw information.

## Key Concepts

### Data Ownership
- **You own your data**: The original data never leaves your control
- **Granular permissions**: Decide who can access and use your data
- **Revocable access**: Grant and revoke permissions at any time

### Privacy-Preserving Computation
- **Encrypted processing**: Data is encrypted during computation
- **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**: Secure enclaves protect data during processing
- **Zero-knowledge**: Compute on data without revealing it

### Monetization
- **Data marketplaces**: Sell access to your protected data
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor how your data is being used
- **Fair compensation**: Get paid for data usage

## How It Works

1. **Protect**: Encrypt and register your data on the iExec network
2. **Share**: Grant access permissions to specific users or applications
3. **Monitor**: Track usage and maintain control
4. **Monetize**: Earn from your data while keeping it private

## Use Cases

- **Personal Data**: Health records, financial data, personal preferences
- **Business Intelligence**: Market research, customer analytics, proprietary datasets
- **AI Training**: Training models without exposing sensitive data
- **Research**: Collaborative research with privacy guarantees
