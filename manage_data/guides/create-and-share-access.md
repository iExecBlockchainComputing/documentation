# üõ°Ô∏è Create and Share Access to Protected Data

**Want to keep your data private while still using it in applications?** Here's
how DataProtector works: first you encrypt your data, then you control exactly
who can access it and when.

Once data is protected, it's only accessible inside secure enclaves (TEEs) by
the specific people and iApps you authorize. No exceptions.

## Quick Start

First, install DataProtector in your project:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @iexec/dataprotector
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @iexec/dataprotector
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @iexec/dataprotector
```

:::

## Protect Your Data

**Here's what happens:** Your data gets encrypted client-side and stored as an
NFT. Only you control who can decrypt and use it.

```ts
import { IExecDataProtectorCore, getWeb3Provider } from '@iexec/dataprotector';

const web3Provider = getWeb3Provider('PRIVATE_KEY');
const dataProtectorCore = new IExecDataProtectorCore(web3Provider);

const protectedData = await dataProtectorCore.protectData({
  name: 'My Email Contact',
  data: {
    email: 'alice@example.com',
    firstName: 'Alice',
    lastName: 'Smith',
  },
});

console.log('Protected data address:', protectedData.address);
```

### What You Can Protect

**Data**: Any JSON object with custom keys. Think user profiles, API
credentials, datasets, model parameters - anything you want to keep private but
still use in computations.

**Supported types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, nested objects, files (convert
to ArrayBuffer first), and arrays (convert to Record format).

**Limits**: File size depends on your storage choice (IPFS or Arweave). For
large datasets, consider using another IPFS node.

### Debug Mode Option

```ts
const protectedData = await dataProtectorCore.protectData({
  data: { email: 'test@example.com' },
  allowDebug: true, // Only for development/testing
});
```

::: warning Debug mode lets you test with debug iApps during development. As
"debug" iApps don't have the same security standards, we recommend using this
mode only during iApp development. :::

## Grant Access

**Here's the key:** The protocol blocks all access to your protected data by
default. You must explicitly grant permission for each app and user combination.

Once you own protected data, here's how to share access:

```ts
const grantedAccess = await dataProtectorCore.grantAccess({
  protectedData: '0x123abc...', // Your protected data address
  authorizedApp: '0x456def...', // iApp that can process the data
  authorizedUser: '0x789cba...', // User who can trigger the processing
  pricePerAccess: 0, // Cost per use (in nRLC)
  numberOfAccess: 10, // Maximum number of uses
});
```

### Parameters Explained

#### `protectedData` <Badge type="danger" text="required" />

The address of your protected data (returned when you created it). **You must
own this data** to grant access.

#### `authorizedApp` <Badge type="danger" text="required" />

**What it is**: The iApp address that's allowed to process your data inside the
secure enclave.

**Why needed**: This ensures only specific, audited applications can access your
data. No random code can touch it.

**Pro tip**: Use app whitelists for production. Instead of a single app address,
you can specify a whitelist contract that contains multiple approved app
versions. Very useful for when you need to upgrade your iApps, without losing
all the granted access.

```ts
// Single app
authorizedApp: 'web3mail.apps.iexec.eth';

// Or use a whitelist (recommended for production)
authorizedApp: '0x781482C39CcE25546583EaC4957Fb7Bf04C277D2'; // Web3Mail whitelist
```

#### `authorizedUser` <Badge type="danger" text="required" />

**What it is**: The wallet address that can initiate processing of your data.

**Why needed**: Even with an authorized app, only specific users can trigger the
computation. This gives you granular control over who uses your data.

**Don't forget**: Even if you are the owner of the data, you need to authorize
yourself!

**Special case**: Set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to allow
**any user** to trigger processing (useful for public datasets).

#### `pricePerAccess` <Badge type="tip" text="optional" />

**Quick explanation**: How much you charge per data usage (in nano RLC - nRLC).

Set to `0` for free access, or specify a price to monetize your data
automatically.

**Example**: `pricePerAccess: 1000000000` = 1 RLC per access

[Manage Data Monetization guide](/manage_data/guides/manage-data-monetization)

#### `numberOfAccess` <Badge type="tip" text="optional" />

**Quick explanation**: Maximum number of times this authorization can be used.

::: warning Important If someone tries to process your data more times than
allowed, they'll get a "no dataset orders" error. Set this high enough for your
use case. :::

**Example values**:

- `1` - Single use (great for one-time data analysis)
- `100` - Limited campaign (email marketing with usage cap)
- `10000` - Effectively unlimited for most use cases

## What's Next?

**You now have protected data with controlled access.** Here are your next
steps:

- **Process the data**: Use
  [processProtectedData](/manage_data/dataProtector/dataProtectorCore/processProtectedData)
  to run computations
- **Manage access**:
  [Revoke](/manage_data/dataProtector/dataProtectorCore/revokeOneAccess) or
  [modify permissions](/manage_data/dataProtector/dataProtectorCore/grantAccess)
  anytime
- **Learn data types**: Deep dive into
  [schemas and dataset types](/manage_data/guides/handle-schemas-dataset-types)
- **Monetize data**: Explore
  [data monetization strategies](/manage_data/guides/manage-data-monetization)

**TL;DR**: Protect data ‚Üí Grant access to specific app + user ‚Üí Data stays
encrypted except inside authorized secure enclaves. You keep full control. üîí
