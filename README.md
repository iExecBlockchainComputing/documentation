### Documentation Quality with Vale

We use [Vale](https://vale.sh/) to maintain high-quality documentation
standards. Vale checks your writing for clarity, consistency, and adherence to
our style guidelines, helping us maintain a coherent tone of voice, accurate
terminology, and overall editorial quality across the project.

#### Installing Vale

```bash
brew install Vale/tap/vale
```

**Linux (Snap):**

```bash
snap install vale
```

**Windows:**

```bash
choco install vale
```

#### Running Vale Locally

```bash
# Download and install external configuration sources
vale sync

# Check all documentation files
vale src/

# Check specific files
vale src/get-started/helloWorld/1-overview.md

# Get detailed output
vale --output=line src/

# Generate comprehensive report with statistics
vale --output=line src/ > vale-report.txt 2>&1
```

#### Vale Rules

Our Vale configuration uses the Google & Vale writing style guide, which helps
ensure:

- Clear and concise language
- Consistent terminology
- Professional tone
- Accessibility best practices

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Some features of the application require environment variables. This
configuration is optional and only needed if you plan to work with Hello World
pages.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project using the provided
`.env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the required values:

```env
VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

#### Getting your VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID

1. Go to [https://dashboard.reown.com/](https://dashboard.reown.com/)
